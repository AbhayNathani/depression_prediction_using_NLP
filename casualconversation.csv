Just got my first acting job,"I absolutely love acting and it is 100% what I’ve wanted to do with my life for as long as I can remember. I did all the school plays and in our local community theatre and my friends and I would make little movies together. It’s just always something I’ve loved doing and I want to do it for the rest of my life. However, I’m more than aware that most people who pursue acting don’t manage to make a career out of it. So now that I’m out of school finding that level of commitment is somewhat difficult. But I just landed my first paid acting job and I am so freaking excited about it!

Don’t get me wrong, I know that one little job doesn’t make me Meryl Streep. But hey, it’s something I’m proud of and I can’t wait to do it! It has its set of challenges for sure, but ones that I’m looking forward to overcoming. It’s a really cool project from a director that I think is just brilliant, and it’s tackling a subject matter I consider to be really interesting and important. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever done before and I am just beyond excited to be a part of it. 

Getting a job is just a small thing, I know. But I’m super psyched about it and thought I would share :)",0
I just got my drivers license!,"I’m 24 years old and was TERRIFIED of driving. I had a bad experience with a driving instructor when I was 15 and was honestly just a terrible driver back then so I never took the behind the wheel exam. I went and took it today and PASSED with flying colors! The examiner didn’t even have suggestions for improvement for me, she said I’m a great driver. 

This is something that’s been weighing on me for almost 10 years. I have a full time job, I pay all my own bills, have my own health insurance and even a goddamn pension and no license…I’m independent in every other way and it was just so embarrassing to tell others that I didn’t drive. It made it so hard to be taken seriously. Knowing that I passed and that I’m actually a good driver is such an incredible weight off my shoulders!! I’m so happy!",0
"What're you itching to do when you turn 18, other than the usuals?","Me personally, I'm reconnecting with a few online friends of some years back on my 18th. Those nine were great people, and I'd happily wait two more years to see 'em again like I promised before I left. ...Well, I mean, I'd like to wait yesterday, but I'd rather a secure return, yeah?

How about you guys? Other than the milestones, what are you counting the days to do when you become an adult?",0
anyone having a crazy year like me? how are you dealing?,"Heyyy guys a few things are going on in my (27M) life and I'll list them here!

- My dad had a heart attack and triple bypass surgery 3 weeks ago
- My grandpa is newly diagnosed terminal, not well 
- I travelled a few provinces away from my gf and puppy for work for 3 months (still away) 
- said gf and I are splitting (pretty fresh) 
- had covid 2 weeks ago and now have a bad flu

Anyways, those are the main ones.. I'm trying to be positive, but sheesh man! Take er a little easier on me, life! 

I am forever thankful for the mutual understanding of our relationship ending, so I can still see my pup, and that my dad Is on the up and up and that I have a great best friend! 

Just with all this happening it's got a bit lonely and confusing so I'd love to hear from some of ya, how are you guys doing?",0
Just want to chat about music!,"I've listened to 98 albums this year and I'm so far behind! I prefer listening to about 300 albums per year, finding new things. Help me find my new three albums to listen to for tonight maybe?

If you recommend me an album we can talk about it as I listen to it!

My preferred genres are Hip-Hop, R&B, Indie Rock, and experimental stuff. But I'm really not too picky at all",0
I Saved My Family's Cat Today,"Just wanted to share something that happened earlier. 
Background: One of our cats has been visibly sick for a number of weeks. She's been checked out and put on different medications, but it hasn't helped much. Normally, she's observed by somebody most of the time, but she managed to sneak away last night, and we couldn't find her. When we realized that she was gone, we looked everywhere for hours with no luck. 

We were all about ready to give up for the night, but I decided to check out the basement one last time, and after searching a while, I stopped at the bottom of the stairs for just a moment to think. Just then, I heard meowing coming from nearby. I thought it was one of the other cats, but nope. I called down my sister, and we located her nearby behind a locked door with stuff blocking it (which is why we hadn't looked before). Turns out she had crawled through a small gap in the wall (which was also mostly blocked off and out of sight) in the other room and gotten stuck in the drainage well thing (I don't know much about these things, apologies). She was down in that cold, wet spot for probably hours. We got her out and cleaned her up, and she's now warm and dry and safe. I just keep thinking about how we could have never found her if I had gone upstairs just a second earlier. She would have perished down there, and it would've been so horrible. Just that split second changed it all. She probably won't make it too much longer, but she's being seen tomorrow by someone, and at least when she goes she'll go out in a nice, peaceful place. It just made me feel good knowing that she isn't suffering any longer. It's just nice to have something good finally freaking happen.

TL;DR: Our sick family cat got stuck, and I found her. It made me feel good.",0
I realized where my cat sleeps at night,"When I first got my cat back in March, she started sitting on my legs or stomach in the night or morning, or even in the afternoon when I'm just chilling in bed. She stopped doing it after a while and it made me sad, because I loved bonding with her and getting to cuddle in that way––she's not very cuddly otherwise, but loves to spend time around me. 

The last few mornings, I naturally woke up pretty early in the morning, and I found my cat sleeping on my legs, or on my stomach one time. To put it into context, when I wake up usually at 9-10am, my cat is either on her favourite tote bag, or sleeping on the corner of my bed. I've started to realize that Ruby (cat's name) tends to sleep on me only when I'm asleep. 

It's a nice thought, even when I'm not conscious of it she's cuddling me in her own little way,

I posted in this sub right before I got my cat and everyone was really encouraging, so consider this a little update. Anyone else have any cute stories of things their pets do at night?",0

Who wants a tarot spread?,"I’ll DM you, even if I can’t get to it tonight. Feel free to DM if you don’t want to ask something publicly.

I’ll be honest, I’m good at picking out cards but I’m really dependent on my book for the actual interpretations and its not always comprehensive. Hope that makes sense :D

I am STREEESSSSEEDDD,"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHGHH. FUCK! Fucking GOD DAMMIT. Salaried for 50 hrs a week, need closer to 70 to get everything done, my fucking home is just another workplace now! Car’s gonna die any day, I’m just trying to pay rent and bills and don’t know what the fuck I’m going to do when that happens. Apparently I owe the IRS and the state tax money, no fucking clue how to fit that into the budget. No extras, no spending on fun or hobbies, no living my own life, I live for the job. I exist for those who want my money. And I should be fucking grateful for it. 

I am grateful. I’m luckier than most. But god dammit. I just want to feel secure. I thought by this age, shit would feel a bit more stable. Maybe in another decade. Though I’m not fucking confident in that. No matter what progress I make, it’s all eaten away by debt, bills, family and work. I move up and feel more down. What’s the fucking point. Any financial fugitives out there? How’s life on the run? Don’t think this is going anywhere meaningful so why not try it out.

Friends are busy and far away, new friends are hard to come by. Partner is amazing and basically all that’s keeping me going. But I can’t keep going in this country like this. Constantly preyed upon. Constantly having to spend all that I make for the most basic of shit. 

I love camping. I’ll live in a fucking tent, off in the woods, out of everyone’s way. Oh wait, that’s not legal either. They want more money if they catch you evading rent prices! Fuck me. Thanks for coming to my fuck you Ted, talk. Sorry if this is “offensive” or too rambling. Just trying to express how it all feels. Hopefully that isn’t against the rules, too.

If this doesn’t fit the sub, please let me know if there’s a sub where I can express openly. Thank you and apologies.",0
Figures of speech …,"So each generation seems to have its own. The last two generations are really aggravating me though. Anyone else notice this? Perhaps I’m just more ornery as time goes on but come on. At least our figures of speech made sense. 

Example: baby boomers said things like “bite your nose to spite your face” stupid phrase, but makes perfect metaphoric sense. 

My Gen (X): yo gimme some skin *slides hands together. Also dumb, but makes sense

Millennials: always over-emphasizing: dude that three pointer was epiccccccc. No it wasn’t. It was merely a good shot. You want epic? Talk to Homer. 

Gen Z: *inserts debit card at grocery store BANK OF AMERICA GODS!LETS GOOOOO. Okay two things here: BOA gods? Really? Gtfo. And this overuse of “lets go” when no “going” is actually taking place? 

At least millennials made sense but they always tried to be “better” than previous generions. Gen Z? Just trying to be “new” hence these TikTok “challenges” and crap. Knock it off. Seriously. 

That is all. /rant",0
i drove a customer somewhere today during my scheduled shift,"i’m 19(f) and i work at a sub shop. a customer came in, not really making much sense but to our understanding, told us that she had her car and purse stolen. i got the impression that she was worried this person was following her, through what she said to me. she sat in the store for about an hour just hiding from the person who stole her stuff and was potentially coming for her. she ended up asking directions to a place that was down the road some and planned on walking there. i offered to take her. she cried really hard the entire ride and i held her hand. i’m really worried about her. i didn’t give her my number (it didn’t occur to me at the moment) and she couldn’t give me hers, she couldn’t even tell me her name. i can’t stop thinking about it. she seemed completely broken. she told me her family essentially broke ties w her and stopped contacting. i gave her a hug when i dropped her off and she talked about how her kids were really mean to her and that she’d never met some strangers (esp kids (young adults, i guess?)) that were so kind, and that it meant a lot bc her kids had abandoned her. 

this all made me incredibly sad. i don’t know the whole story or anything so i don’t know what’s true and not true, or what her family’s side of the story is or whatever. i don’t know exactly what was going on, i just saw an incredibly broken person and it hurt a lot. i really hope she’ll be okay.",0

I know this will sound stupid but…,I used to get bullied in high school. This an embarrassing moment. The girl was really evil. But at the beginning of this bullying development. I like stood up for myself. “I was like why are you acting like” this or something like that. The bully responded with something like. “Oh we are friends” which I did not expect. I just kinda nodded and retreated because I kinda thought I was hurting her feelings. I was just a knee jerk reaction because I did not expect it. It was so dumb even as I was doing it. I was like what the fuck.,0

I just spent way to much money on supplies for my classroom.,"Couldn’t help it, Target had some great deals. This used to bother me when I first started teaching…but at year 25, I’m just excited to go on the journey with a new set of fresh faces and curious minds.",0
Do you ever explain something to yourself?,"I have had this quirk for as long as I remember, so I’m curious how common it is amongst other redditors.

I find myself fairly often explaining a process or system to myself in my head, step by step, as if I’m teaching someone who has never heard of the concept. For example, I just set up a smart lightbulb with my Google home, and I was thinking about all the ways to turn on and off the light bulb. (Regular light switch, lamp switch, and now wifi.) I was basically thinking out, step by step, how each trigger affects the light bulb and their relationships. (ie if I turn off the main light switch, I won’t be able to use my Google speaker to turn on/off the light.)

It’s all very simple, so it’s not like it’s a very worthwhile endeavor since I obviously already know how it works, I’m just reiterating it… to myself. I find myself doing it often with devices or setups in my house. If I had to guess why, it’s to feel the satisfaction of knowing something backwards and forwards, in case I ever *do* have to explain it to someone else (which is incredibly unlikely.)

Who else does this? Is this a weird habit or is it more common than I realize?",0
I have dreams but my brain is just shit,"Hey you. I hope you're doing okey with life but if you're not.. I'm so sorry.

So as my title says, I have a few dreams for my life but my whole 20's was pretty much ripped away from me and everything I once worked really hard for had to be put on hold or given up completely due to mental health issues. Since then my interests has changed completely, my personality just as much. I'm a 30 year old woman who I know deep down has a lot to offer but the world isn't very colorful most of my days.

I'm beginning to recover and I've come quite far just in the past 6 months. I know my mind will always struggle more or less but I'm now okey with that.

Anyways! For some years I've always dreamed of starting my own podcast which kind of goes against my whole personality in real life where I'm quite introverted but online I can be very social and engaging. I've streamed on Twitch couple years ago for quite a while but it never really felt like it was satisfying enough socially speaking. I still game like a motherfucker though and gained a lot of great friends over the years. I really like to get to know people, talk to them on a deeper level, listen and discuss things above all. I'm really curious about the human psyche and everything that makes us us. The podcast could perhaps have different themes for every episode, and not only about mental health. I've got a small studio at home with all the gear required. But it's just sitting there collecting dust particles..

If you're still here reading you might wonder what's stopping me and yes that's exactly what my problem is. I wouldn't want to be alone doing it, and I got nobody to talk to about these ideas, and since my motivation quite often crashes I easily lose the little drive I have. But ask me tomorrow and I might feel different, that's the tricky part. I listen to podcasts a lot and every god damn time I feel like it would be something I would really enjoy and then the ideas starts flooding in. Then after a few hours they wither away, IT IS SO INFURIATING, SHIT SHIT SHIT.... shit.

Thank you for sticking around to the end of this post.  
I hope you heal from the things you don't talk about.  
Please talk about them. Deal?",0
yesterday I played in the snow with my friends. we are all 18-19 yo,"So we were celebrating one of my mates bday and it had snowed the day before which is something pretty uncommon in my city. We were having drinks playing games and what not and eventually we went out to his yard to smoke and someone had the great idea to start a snowball war. 

We started running after each other making monkey  noises (don't know why either) and hitting ourselves with the snow will laughing our asses off. It was by far one of the funniest moments I had in quite a few time. Just 5 grown ass guys playing like kids in the snow it just made me very happy.

So that's the whole story just wanted to share this really stupid/fun moment I had with the boys

Edit: typo",0
Anyone here feels like they just got bored of games?,"A while ago I found that each game I start I only play for like 30 min to an hour and just stop. I feel like I just saw everything there is to see in that time. I haven't finished a single game for years. But now I feel like I just can't get myself to play any game anymore.

The way that I'm dealing with it is that I'm making my own game in my free time. I don't know if there will be any interest in it, but it's what what I'd like to play. The idea is it's a fully dialogue-based interactive drama game about working for a bad boss in a place where coworkers try to sabotage each other for a promotion. The process of making it has been very enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to how it turns out. 

Anyway, does anyone feel like you just can't play games anymore? What do you think is the reason?",0
Does anyone else daydream constantly or is it just me?,"I'm always had an active imagination. Even in preschool I remember always being stuck inside my own head. As I've gotten older with more responsibilities, it's lessened a bit overall. However, for the past few weeks I've wanted to do nothing but be alone with my own thoughts and daydream.

I'm not sure if it's a coping mechanism or an anxiety response of some kind because I've been so overwhelmed lately. It is nice to take a vacation in my mind every now and then, but it's kind of gotten out of control recently.

Just wanted to see if anyone else experiences this.",0

How can I stop letting people be extremely influential to me and stop copying off of others?,"I have noticed that a significant flaw of mine is that I allow others to be extremely influential to me. I have allowed others to negatively influence me into doing things that I wouldn’t do.

Anyone else hardened by life / society?,"Not to sound like a tough guy, but I feel like my compassion has tanked horribly the past couple of years.
I went from having to swallow tears because I wasn't able to help a nice person to just.. not caring. About anything. Hate to say it but my job deals with the public and when someone tells me their life story I just think ""please shut up, youre not the only one who has a hard life, you're not a main character.""
Maybe its because i focus too much on the matter, but suddenly everyone wants to talk about how hard their life is. I know, everyone has a hard life, especially in the turn of this new decade.. I honestly can't be bothered to care anymore. The workplace calls it compassion fatigue, but I just think the disappointment these past few years has turned me into a rigid being. I'm not being outwardly mean to people, but.. when Im socially cued to act like i sympathize, it takes a lot for me to do that. 
I dont openly talk about my problems, because i just dont want to add to the crap i hear every day from people. Im still somewhat of a softie, i still cry over the dumbest things in private when Ive bottled in enough things, but.. in general, I've lost that hope I had when I was a younger kid, and I dont care about others like i used to. And i dont think it'll change.

Also, SORRY I basically just told my own dumb life story after ragging on others for doing the same thing.. I don't vent to strangers or even family like these people do. I feel like i should, to cope better. But my logic is that everyone suffers in their own way, and adding my woes to conversation is so unneeded.",0

"I decided to only listen, I can't contribute","I have read many literature in Arabic, English and somali and I really liked what I was reading, I felt sometimes that I was reading about myself in some works which made me more drawn to them and praise the writers for it too.

Because of that experience I had with engaging with their art I always thought that I will definitely create some day too, I will make my own work that will make people feel the things that I have felt.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case after I grew up and tried creating, I realised maybe I'm still missing something that all those great people had, I don't know what that is, so I decided I won't try and I will be satisfied with just listening and enjoying their works. Or atleast share their art with other people too.

How often do you text your friends?,"I have some friends from high school that I consider close friends. At this point, we all live in different cities so we only see each other in person a few times per year and stay in contact mostly through texting

I go through times when I really want to text them a lot. I guess I just really want to have a conversation with them, with anyone really. A stranger would also work, even though my friends would work better (because I already know them, less energy and stuff). And I will engage in long conversations with them for a few days. But then, I am not sure how to put it, my social battery runs out? I no longer feel like texting them and I do not contact them in a month or two. I feel tired and distant, and in need of a “break” from them

I start medical school in 3 days and I’m so scared.,"I’ve been working towards this my entire life, and I’ve hit my lowest lows to get here. But now that I’m here, I’m terrified. What if I don’t make friends and am lonely? What if I fail all my preclinical classes? The sheer amount of information I’ll need to learn is nerve-wracking in and of itself. I just downloaded a “must-have” notecard deck with over 35k cards! I don’t know if I’m good enough.

I keep reading horror stories about interns and 3rd year students and residents who are miserable and always being yelled at and made to feel like shit by attendings, or students who didn’t match and are now $300k in debt with no job. I can’t believe my college friends in business and engineering are already adulting with jobs and salaries, and here I am choosing to put myself into 6 figure debt just to do more school and more applications and be yelled at by people. I keep thinking, “Have I lost my mind?”

That being said, I think I’ll be an excellent doctor. I think I’m capable and I know I have a great work ethic and I’ve been told I’m wonderful with people/patients. I love learning. It’s just…the process of getting there. I’m so overwhelmed and anxious.",0

I was hilariously blamed for shit going tits-up on a Star Trek ride.,"I haven’t thought about it in a long time and have no idea why I thought about it now: went to Vegas in 2000. Huge Star-Trek nerd so I had to go to the Star Trek experience, have a drink in Quarks bar and ride the thing. When we got seated in the shuttle, I just happened to be seated by the window, where there are fakey control panels, so I started pushing buttons, like you do. Of course shit went tits-up, malfunction and warping into the middle of a space-battle or something like that. When we finally “docked” a crew member came to extract us, pointed at me directly and blamed me for the malfunction cuz I wouldn’t leave the buttons alone. So fun. Tell me of a amusement ride you especially remember.",0
What electronic product or related accessory should I buy?,"Long story short, I’m not from the UK and I need to buy iPhone and iPad cases from Amazon UK and the delivery cost is quite high. Buying locally is not an option due to limited choice and overpriced products.

What else should I buy to justify such high delivery costs? 

I’m not obsessed with Apple even though it looks like it since my workplace keeps giving me new Apple devices so in all, the workplace and self-bought electronics I have are:

Macbook Pro 2018, 
Macbook Pro 2021, 
iPhone 13, 
Magic Mouse, 
Magic Keyboard, 
iPad 2017, 
Apple pencil for digital drawing on iPad,
Airpods Pro, 
Bose QC 35 ii headphones, 
and a PS4. 

My price range is EUR 30-60. Any standalone electronic product/s or an accessory that goes with the above products that you’d like to recommend? 

Thank you! :)",0

Now i accept every invite and get some energy from socializing. It’s funny because I’ve noticed a lot of extroverted people I knew growing up are becoming introverted! They’re like “I don’t have the energy anymore to be around people I don’t know. I suddenly prefer to stay inside.” Basically the old me. It’s like roles reverse the older we get or something.",0

Does anyone get weird ads for the “Zombie Shooter” game Age of Origins? Because the game is nothing like that.,"Just clicked the download link after seeing the 1000’th Age of Origins advertisement and had some downtime today. Eh, the hell, that looks vaguely fun, let’s shoot some zombies. 

…except the game is nothing at all like the ads. It’s a basic click-and-build Tower Defense game. They apparently rendered all this fake cgi gameplay footage to rope people in to a game that doesn’t really exist? Doesn’t that seem super weird?

someone just bumped into me while driving,"I am a new driver and this is the first time I encountered such a thing.

I also didn't care much since this was a beaten up old car with lots of bumps and the impact was so small that I was sure there would be no damage.

"I need to sell stuff to make a big important change in my life, but it worries me.","I'm a musician and a lover of diversity and newness.

Would you be interested to read an e-book about my story?,"I'm not a special person, just a 33-year-old guy from Hungary who likes to play video games, likes to try himself at all kinds of creative works, is interested in the landscapes and mysteries of the world... and who incidentally has a rare disease called SMA1. Together with my parents, we try to get by every day, and although even the most ordinary tasks are a big challenge for us, we do our best to live a meaningful life. Last year, I made a book in which I write like a diary about a year of my life, about the struggles, joys, failures, and successes. It was also important for me to include my older sister's writings and poems because even though we lost her a few years ago, she will remain with us forever. This book was written in Hungarian, but I thought that if I had it translated into English, would you be interested? (The e-book would be a gift for donators.) Comment your opinions.

Do you think it's okay to insult your friends as long as you both think you're joking?,"Sometimes I wonder when you have friends who really insult each other as a joke why that's okay. It's okay because you know they're just kidding, but obviously the joke had to come from someplace. Are there certain things you and your friends don't joke about?

Like if I know my friend sucks as an artist but they really like doing it, and I joke about one of their shitty drawings, I feel bad because that's a real thought I have. But if we're joking it's not meant to offend them and they laugh it off. I just wonder sometimes why that's okay because I can get how it could hurt someone's feelings if they didn't assume I was kidding. 

Sometimes I don't like that the jokes I think of come from bad places, even if they're not meant to be offensive really. Or they are meant to be offensive and that's what makes it funny that you would say something like that to a friend. That's what makes it funny, but it's actually hurtful and awful. Anyone else have that feeling?",0
Have you ever got nervous to try something new just to find out later that it was not so bad as you thought?,"🏠 Long story short, I was born in a conservative family where my parents taught me in every way that was wrong for men to be feminine, even playing with dolls or wearing pink clothes,

so It's no surprise that I was the family scapegoat because being a macho man figure wasn't really my cup of tea, but somehow I still felt insecure to break their ""rule"".

🐱 Anyway, today I decided to break the rule again by wearing leggings in public, felt super nervous (as usual) but after walking few blocks away I found out that it was just a pair of pants, a bit tight but very comfy, I loved it!

And again I felt stupid for being worried over nothing, every bad thing that I was imagining to happen was just my imagination all along..

Have you ever felt like this as well?",0
My investment account just got hacked and my money was emptied out. Still in shock :'(,"I (29f) have been doing some steady investments for the past two years with one broker company which is very reliable and trustable. The returns have been satisfactory, and I've been happy with it.

Earlier today, I received news that there's been a hacker (or a team of hackers?)  who's been hacking into people's accounts and transferring their money out. My friend advised me to set up two-factor authorisation, but I was busy with work all day and haven't had the time to do it.

One hour ago, I received an email saying that a transfer has been made that cleared out all the balance in my account. It was a lot of money, and I've been trying to digest it for the past hour, yet I still feel nothing.

I wrote a support ticket to the company's customer service, but I know there isn't anything they can do, as it's not their fault. They can't trace back the hacker, and they can't return me my money.

I've never experienced anything so surreal. Seriously. Have you? I don't really know what to do or feel or think. I'm just feeling dumb and numb right now. Obviously, I've set up two-factor authorisation by now (duh, huh?). But now what...?",0
my dog died a little over a month ago and i just wanna show pictures of/talk about her,"to preface, this isn’t supposed to be sad. i’m not sad right now, just bored at work. i’ve wanted to share stuff of her for a long time now; so i am :D  

i got delilah when [we were both little babies](https://imgur.com/a/1VlvEGc). i was six, and she was born in my lap

she was my literal baby. [she always slept with me since we got her](https://imgur.com/a/qiw4reA). i also couldn’t pronounce delilah when i was younger, so i called her yaya. that nickname stuck for her whole life 

her whole life, she always acted like a puppy. she was thirteen when she died, and only within the two days of her passing was when she was different. 

on thursday, she passed out from overexcitement (presumably, we never knew for sure) and peed herself. two minutes later she seemed normal. friday i took her to the vet, she said she had a heart murmur. sunday evening, we were sitting in my room and she yelps like something hurt her. i go over to her and suddenly she’s panting and her heart is racing. this lasted until monday. it was my first day of work at a new job, so my mom took her to the vet. she said she was in heart failure, and gave her a bunch of meds. i thought she would be okay. my dad came to find me at around 11 (we work at the same place) telling me that she didn’t make it. it was like my world was ending. fun first day! 

i didn’t think this would end up sad lol. to make it un-sad, she was my favorite thing on this planet, and she will always be my baby. she was the cutest thing, she would snort and sneeze when she would get excited lol. and loved car rides. and she hated vegetables. when my dad makes shepards pie, he gives the dogs some, and she would literally [PICK OUT THE VEGETABLES](https://imgur.com/a/IqyMk06) and put them on the floor. 

we have another dog, [ruby,](https://imgur.com/a/H8SL5b2) and they were besties. delilah was the boss though, and that white spot on her nose is from when they were playing one time and delilah nipped her. they would also always kiss (lick) each other. that was gross

she lived to be thirteen, [and my mom took this picture of us the day she died.](https://imgur.com/a/Jm9aTYc) 

i have a necklace of her and a lil delilah shrine in my room. i still keep all her toys in my room too. 

[here are a few more pictures i wanna show,](https://imgur.com/a/y4vs5Eu) and i’m sure i’ll think of more to add later. also, [this is from her scratching at my door to get in from the past nine or so years](https://imgur.com/a/Al0d1eo). but yeah, that’s my baby yaya

edit: i’m getting so many wonderful comments and i appreciate them so much. to my understanding, the op needs to reply to each top level comment within three hours. i’m at work so i can’t do that rn so mods please don’t remove anything 😅 i want to respond to everyone because i genuinely love all of the comments, i just wasn’t expecting this because i randomly wrote it at work when i had nothing to do 😭 thank you all though. you’re all very sweet and it makes me happy :)",0

Do you think it should be socially acceptable for men to wear leggings in public?,"How about short shorts? Do you think men should be allowed to wear these in public without judgment why or why not?

I ask because it seems like we generally agree freedom is good, but there are still things we feel uncomfortable with for whatever reason. And it seems like it's okay for certain things to not be equal as long as most people agree it makes them uncomfortable, but things used to make people uncomfortable which we now accept just because enough people wanted to do it. I guess that's fair?",0

First solo in class,"I’ve been taking hip hop classes for about 6 months now. Normally, at the end of class, we break into small groups to run the choreo.

"tonight, my girlfriend is getting a boyfriend","I (20f) have been with my girlfriend (21f) for about over a year and a half rn. before dating, she and i had been best friends for about 8 years. for context, I'm a very monogamous asexual lesbian, she's polyamorous and bisexual. she didn't know about her identity until before we started dating, she figured out she was bi when she started having feelings for me and after being friends with benefits she asked me out. i had been in love with her since math class together in high school when we were 11 and 12 respectively.

starting to date her was the best thing that's happened to me. i have no doubt she's my one. after a year and a jalf we're still going strong, i love her more than anything and i feel so loved as well. we moved in together a few weeks ago.

problems started to arise when i introduced her to my best friend. i started a new school a few months ago, and it being a mostly male environment (programming) i made a male friend. due to some issues I've always had issues trusting men, but this guy became my best friend, he's always made me feel comfortable, respectful of boundaries and just always had an overall good time with him.

after about 2 months, my girlfriend told me she had feelings for him. i kinda saw it coming, but hearing it felt like getting stabbed in the chest. i didn't want to hear any of it. what if she just straight up left me for him in the long run? i expected her to have other partners, but in no way was i happy with that other partner being my best friend, a guy i see at school every day of the week and who i sit and work with and hang out during lunch all the time. how could i ever be fine with that?

it was very painful. i told my girlfriend i wasn't okay with it. she understood why. even before telling me she knew i wouldn't be happy about it, but we always make it a point to be honest with each other even about the hard stuff. she agreed to forget about him. it made me sad to see her that way.

my best friend isn't polyamorous per say, but he's had poly partners in the past, and i know he likes my girlfriend, he told me so as he didn't want to feel like he was stirring shit in our relationship. he promised to stay away and never attempt anything on her. and I trust him, they haven't, he's had the opportunity many times, and he hasn't. he's always respected my boundaries, and hers. i really love him, as a friend that is.
it's been about 3 weeks since my girlfriend confessed that she liked him. it wasn't easy, but I've just come to realize that all i want is her happiness. i think we could make this work. I'm an introvert who really enjoys my space, so i talked about it with my girlfriend and we agreed to some terms: she would still live with me only, he wouldn't live with us (altho I'm fine with him moving closer eventually, it's just we currently all just freshly moved in a new place) and we still have just her and i time. i definitely don't think this type of arrangement is for everyone, i just happened to enjoy being alone a lot, so what if my girlfriend can have a good time while i enjoy my time? she's also wanted to explore sexually, but then i happened, and we're each other's first ever partners. she knew how i felt about it, and she's always respected my boundaries. i feel without a doubt that i can trust her.

i want to fully embrace everything about her. i myself am autistic, i haven't always been the easiest to deal with. yet ever since we're children, she's been my best friend, always caring and kind, taking the time to explain to me what i didn't understand, never made me feel like i was annoying to deal with, she's always made me feel better about myself, and her liking my best friend hasn't changed that, so i wondered why couldn't i be fine with it?

my girlfriend is currently with her therapist, her terapist has been in vacations so she hasn't had a sessiom for 5 weeks. I'm letting her unravel all of this but my decision is taken, we've talked about it.

so tonight, my girlfriend is getting a boyfriend. I'm not expecting everything to go smoothly. I'm by nature a pretty insecure person, so i may get jealous sometimes, but i do know we can make it work, nothing's ever stopped us before.",0
My cat is so fine with the weather he could live on the sun,"Every summer I see people posting stuff about not letting dogs and cats outside because the hot ground will burn their paws, or stuff about making sure you have a cool place for them because with their fur they'll suffer.

But when I see my cat I think these posts are either bullshit or my cat is an alien.

We have a little cat trap door so he can come in and out whenever he wants but in these hot days of summer we almost never see him in. But sometimes I get out for some reason and suddenly the cat rushes at me asking to be pet while laying on the hot stone floor casually. 

I don't know what he is doing out there but I bet he wouldn't mind being under the sun for the whole day if I was outside to pet him.",0
I love taking drowning bugs out of the swimming pool,"As the title says. My father's house has a swimming pool outdoors, and as usual, bugs fall into it. Mostly moths, flies, and wasps. I spend many hours fishing them out and putting them outside. It's so cool. Many moths seem to be dead as they have stopped moving; but as soon as I scoop them out, they begin flicking their legs, their wings, cleaning themselves and eventually they fly away. It's like they were staying still because they had lost hope of getting out of the water somehow. I don't know if insects can feel those emotions, but I hope they're happy they did not die!
The other day I took out a bee with my bare hands, then left it on a nearby big flower. I watched it dry itself and then fly away. I did the same with a wasp, and then left it on a tree branch. Then I took another one and put it beside the other one. I watched them closely and I realised they had different colored eyes! One of them had black eyes and the other's were blue or gray. I didn't know wasps came with different eyes! It was cool to learn that.
Then I took out a butterfly. It was small, but its wings were very pretty, with differently colored spots. I love watching bugs up close, it's really cool how they move their legs and antennae to get dry once they're outside of the water.

Any tips on how to stay awake after you turn your alarm off? Because I tend to turn the thing off then go right back to sleep which is a problem. I know that probably has more to do with the fact I don't have enough reasons to be conscious, but any help would be appreciated.

A woman I never met is the reason my voice sounds the way it sounds,"My mother was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. She was adopted by my grandparents, who live in western NY. 
Obviously, my mother gave birth to me. 

My mother has never met her mother, no clue who she is. The adoption record falls short because a fake name was used, and so we’ll never know who she is. 

But there is something I got from her, this woman i’ll never meet. My voice. My mom used to have a speech therapist as a child, because she had a hint of a Southern accent in her speech. 

Apparently, babies listen to the sound of their mothers speaking, and learn the nuances speech and the pitch of their voice from their mothers, before they’re even born. So, my mother got the deeper southern voice. Even today she pronounces some things a little peculiarly because of the accent, despite never actually developing the accent. Even I sometimes have slipped into more southern-sounding speech, despite never having been down south for anything more than a vacation.

But I got my own deeper voice from my mom, and so I always enjoy thinking that someone I’ve never met, someone I’ll never meet, is the reason I’ve got a deep voice and the ability to slip into a southern accent at the snap of some fingers.",0

How's your life and how are you doing? What are your next big goals and milestones?,"Hey stranger, I just wanted to check up on you. Are you happy? are you excited about something coming up? maybe you're at the best point of your life?. Even if you're sad, tell me because I want to try and lift up your mood.

  
Personally, I am happy although I get some stressful days in my week it's okay we all get that. I live in Japan and also go to University here to study Psychology, I enjoy living amongst long-time friends from middle school and my mother's side of the family although I haven't talked to my mother in a while and my father's recent passing put a huge mental toll on me and I chose to distance my self from her and my little sisters to avoid having another breakdown but I did promise myself to contact her once I leave for the US next year to meet her. My current part-time job as a chef at my town's local restaurant is going well and I like doing this as a hobby although that is not my dream(s). My dream is to write a book, let others read my creativity, and make music, let others enjoy my ~~sick riffs~~ tunes. I know they might sound like delusions of grandeur but I am determined. 

I am new to Reddit and wanted to make some friends hopefully you're willing to. If not then let us have a small talk!",0

I failed my driving test.,"Instructor took off THREE marks (you can lose upto 8 and still pass) because I slightly extend my fingers when I turn (almost everyone I know does this. I guess he expects me to squeeze the wheel with a death grip). He called it ""turning with my palm"" which is bs because I'm still gripping the wheel properly (my thumbs are still on the 'inside' of the wheel). I literally never heard about this rule and all my friends do it and they passed their test and they've never heard of this 'rule' either. The other mistakes were probably due to  butterflies in my stomach because the feedback was vague and I genuinely didn't even understand what I did wrong. Sigh.",0
How do you come to terms with the fact that you'll never be able to do everything?,"I'm on basically the last highschool summer break I'm ever gonna have, and every day I wake up and I'm feeling the same like, kind of existential dread. I have 24 hours in a day, but way too many things I wanna do on top of obviously sleep, hygiene, food and all that. 

Like I have 3 different video games I wanna get better at and rank up in, dozens of other video games I wanna play and experience, hundreds of unwatched shows, movies, books, anime.

And that's not even accounting for more productive stuff like homework, studying and my own projects I wanna do. It just feels like every day I have to pick and choose what things I wanna do and it feels like life is on a constant ticking timer, and I'm wasting time if I don't do that other thing I wanted to do. I have the fear of growing up and going to college, and getting a job, and having to pay for rent, food, and everything else and not having time for the hobbies I wanna have. I feel like I'm at the time in my life where I have the most amount of time, and it's only going to go downhill from here, especially as next year starts and I get busy with all the difficult classes I signed up for but have to motivation to try in.

Obviously you can't get everything done, nobody is immortal of course. But do any other people have this fear, and if so how do you guys cope with it?",0

I've always taken a bit of pride in not feeling like I need to be in a romantic relationship but I kinda just don't feel that way anymore.,"I've never had like any type of crush or anyone that I've looked at or heard and thought ""*that's someone I want to be with*"" or anything like that, but lately and inexplicably, I'm feeling some kind of bland, grey feeling of loneliness, and for lack of better words, feels like a missing puzzle piece that only another person could possess. Like someone I don't know has the key to my happiness. 

But I also feel this sort of anguish, of full color and saturation but only a small amount of power, kinda like a small vibrant gemstone. And  i think it's there because I feel like I won't ever be able to find that person with the key. I'm a unique person, and even though most of my emotions can be explained in a single coloquial word, they have a slightly different shape from other people's. The chance that I find that person or the chance of that person finding me is frankly abysmal. It doesn't matter to me if that person is male, female, nonbinary, mentally or physically disabled, I'm just kinda in a state of indefinite greyness without them.

There's just tons of factors that stack into this ultimate, indestructible cage that makes me feel close to humanity, but far from person-hood.

I have a week off next week so I don’t know if I’ll even go in tomorrow when I’m supposed to. I said I had a stomach ache etc but when they phoned yesterday I said I was feeling better but still had bad diarrhoea. I feel kind of guilty about it. This is my 3rd absence since January.

It’s the middle of the night and I’m sitting on my bathroom floor with my animals,"It’s the middle of the night and I just woke up for that 1 am water chug and pee, you know the vibes, and my cat was sitting on the mat in the bathroom.

They’ve never not gotten along, but they’ve never really been besties either. My dog just wants to play and my cat wants none of it.

"They Say Failure is the Best Teacher, but my latest failure just got me totally down...","I wrote a book, but since I can't draw to save my life, I paid a hefty amount to an artist. 

While he did a very good job, I had to do a lot of extra work (e.g. coloring in the background, grammar edits, etc.).

Once I started posting on social media, nobody cared. So I spent a bit of extra money on marketing/ads. Although in the beginning, it seemed to do the trick, eventually I learned the hard way that converting followers/likes into sales is not an easy task.

All in all, I basically sold my car (\~2 years ago, so at a much worse price than what it would be today ironically) for all the artwork/marketing expenses, but have only ended up recouping about **2%** of that. 

In other words, I'm down **98%**

A funny realisation 😂😂😅,"When I was in 11th grade, the was the girl that use to “pick fights” with me. It used to make me angry coz I didn’t do anything to deserve that.

Now it’s 5 or 6 years later it’s hitting me.😂😂

Regardless, I was never interested in her. But if I knew this then I would have dealt with her better.",0

saw an old classmate today,"I've been out of high school for 5 years or so now and never really came across any of my peers in my day to day life post graduation, at least for the most part. I just went to an art class that I regularly attend twice a week and someone that I went to elementary/middle school and high school with was there. We didn't really talk much, but it was interesting to me that we remembered each other. I've always been hesitant with people from my past/who I knew as a kid. Even toward classmates who were vaguely nice/neutral to me in school as a child, I tend to shy away from them. Not quite sure why.

Anybody else have a story about meeting old classmates you haven't seen in years? Could be good, bad, ugly, or even just neutral, I'm curious.",0
I called my boss out and it felt so good,"Before you bring it up this is an alt account.

So my boss was trying to dog on me about not putting in my hours and acting dumb and asking where my money was. But that's not how it went.

I had put in a hard week for my boss because someone called out (this is a small Business BTW hence weird payment I have to text hours it dumb I know). I had texted my hours to her and didn't get payed. She told me that it would be delayed and I was fine with it. Another week passed and I worked weird hours and told her that we should just combine it with the next week which I knew was going to be slow. About 3 days later I asked when I was going to be payed and needless to say she was not happy(this money I asked about was for the week I covered for someone). Important info she is also my neighbor and later that day shit talked me to my parents who I live with. To put it this way she called me stupid in far worse words. I soon talked to her and clarified what I was asking for and no apology for her yelling at me. I got payed and was over it; I had started to look for a new job. About a week or so later she tried to grill me on being irresponsible in front of my coworkers  on this topic. Little did she know I had the text messages where she.... 

1. Told me that my payment would be late not telling me when it should show
2. Agreeing with me on the plan to put the two odd days with the next week
3. That she miss red things on my payment problem

After she grilled me in front of my coworkers I corrected her and showed the texts were she was wrong. and she was super piss needless to say my hours have been cut big time but I don't want to work for a person like that ever again hope I find a good job ASAP.",0

I think I want to start playing basketball.,"Hey folks! For sometime now I’ve been slowly noticing I have an interest in learning how to play basketball. All the women that I know that ball in my life are fierce and they look so invincible and strong on the court. I want to experience that joy myself!

I had a ball phase in elementary school and it ended fairly abruptly because the captain of the team I joined back then very passively bullied me. The coach really liked her because she was very skilled and popular. The shunning and exclusion kinda crushed me, I was always on the bench. I took basketball seriously at the time and would try to practice on weekends/after school; I didn’t know what to focus on so I just wasn’t good in time for the tournament LOL

Now as an adult who has a number of hobbies, I would like to give basketball another shot and push back at this idea that I’m not good at it. 

Does anyone here ball? Where should I start? What do you love about the game?

"People outside the Midwest, have you ever had Blue Moon ice cream?","As a child growing up near the Wisconsin border, I have fond memories of going to the ice cream shops near me and having blue moon ice cream. I thought blue was a strange color for ice cream to have but aside from that, I never questioned it. Recently however, I went to a shop that had descriptions for all their flavors. I read the description for blue moon, and it said the flavor came mostly from almond extract. That was very peculiar, and the more I thought about it, I realized I couldn't describe the flavor. I looked it up, and it turns out that no one knows what the flavor is, and that the flavor is only in the Midwest. This shook me to my very core. Of all the things in my life, I never thought blue moon would be something rare.

"What the hell am I supposed to answer when someone asks me what my ""type""?? What do you do in that situation?","I've been in this situation a couple of times and honestly, I still don't know the answer. I like people, ~~all~~ most of them!  
When they say ""type"", are they talking about the physical appearance? Or is it more about personality? I think having a table with examples of all the different types would be very helpful.

&#x200B;

When it comes to physical appereance, I think I don't really care, although I've never met someone with expensive clothings that I've really liked. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I whenever I talk with one of them I feel like they're not interested in me and I need to ""earn"" their interest, and it just feels dumb.  
I don't know the different types of ""outfits"" and ""styles"", but whenever I walk in the streets, I always find a lot of beautiful people of all different shapes and sizes. Humans are so good-looking! It's hard to say what I like, I think I just like everything.

&#x200B;

When it comes to personalities, I think I have a preference for those who are confident and are not scared of talking about the things they love. I'm also completely in love with energetic people. I once met someone in a bar who spent (literally, I counted it) 20 minutes talking to me about Amelia Earhart (she read (and maybe memorized?) a very interesing article about her) with no interrumptions whatsoever, and it was fun!But I also like it when someone is quiet, they're so misterious! What are they hiding?? The only problem I have is that they make it harder to mantain a conversation, and usually that makes me talk about myself, which, hands down, I kinda like it, but I hate it when I'm the only topic of the conversation.

This year I moved to a different city, and I've met a lot of people. Something I realized is that it's easier for me to talk to girls than boys, and I'm not sure why. I don't see any major difference between them, so maybe it's just a problem with me. I also noticed that I like to talk to people older than me. They all just seem more... interesting? I guess that makes sense, they've been on this planet for a longer time. I also found it harder to talk to people from my country (I was an exchange student, just like almost everyone else), and I'm not sure why. But they all were the same age as me, so maybe the problem was the age and not the nationality. Or maybe the fact that they had a similar childhood to mine makes me find them more... boring?

&#x200B;

So, when someone asks me what my type is, should I just say that I like older, foreign, extrovert women? Is that what a type is? I mean, I like everyone, I just have more fun talking with those people.",0

Best avenue for getting a dog with a toddler at home?,"My family is ready for a dog. But we have a 3 year old human child. Normally, I wouldn't even consider buying a dog from a breeder and would be looking at adoption. But, **with a 3 yo human in the house, is it better to bring home a bred puppy from a breed known to be great with kids, rather than risk a shelter/foster dog with an unknown past?**

There are some puppies for adoption from rescues near me, but they are all mixed with breeds not particularly known for friendliness (German shepherds, pits, and etc). This would not worry me at all if my son wasn't 3 and just learning boundaries. I've had 3 shelter dogs in my life and 1 from a breeder. My husband and I agree that if we ""shop"" again this time, we will only adopt going forward, once our son isn't a toddler. But I'm having quite a lot of guilt over the idea of ""shopping"".

Amongst other things, many times I want the food someone is offering me and I refused or even gotten the wrong food and stayed quiet. I've also stayed quiet at a hairdresser when they were hurting my scalp or overcharged me for a hideous haircut. 

Lot of friends with whom I took time to warm up have told me that the first impression I made was of a snob.
Knowing this hasn't helped!",0
Funny how people who see strange things in dreams in TV shows are nearly always outstanding artists,The nightmare or similar which indicates something spooky going on. Then they start drawing these impressive renditions (possibly actually concept art) of what they saw. Convenient,0
a cat followed my car to get pets from me,"She was so cuddly. I pulled in and came up to her. She came up to me, rubbed against me and purred up a storm. I think she was older but I'm pretty sure she had an owner. Just wanted some love. The way she looked at me in my rear view mirror I couldn't drive away. She was white with black and brown spots and looked up at me with so much love while she purred like an engine. I love her

What if you're the catastrophe the universe was saving someone else from,"We like to think that we meet people for a reason. And sometimes we think people leave our lives because its probably the best thing for us. 

But if that's the case, that would mean that one person had to be detrimental to the other. 

Has anyone ever stopped to think that *they* were actually the person that might have ruined a perfectly good person? Like, you're the toxic vampire that would have ended up destroying this other person, rather than thinking you're the hero of your story ?",0
Do you like fruits? No? Well.. eat them anyway.,"I'm from Europe, but I hate going to the doctor.

Lucky me, I never had a serious health issue, but the last time I visited my  GP (general practitioner? ) that's what she asked me.

I lied, of course.  

And then she said, I would have prescribed you vitamins, but since you like fruits... just eat them.


I was too ashamed to say that even tho I like fruits *in theory*, or as a concept, I most certainly do not eat them...

But so many people tell me that even the best, most expensive vitamins are crap and it's so much better to just eat your fruits and vegetables...

Weekend plans?,"I’ve successfully avoided the plague for the last two years, but it finally caught up with me. I’ve spent last weekend isolating, and looks like I’ll be doing the same this weekend as well.

I was actually supposed to see a comedy show last weekend and hang out with friends, and I’m sad to have missed out on that and just not being able to hang with anyone for a week now.

I thought it might cheer me up to hear other people’s weekend plans and live vicariously through you— wether it’s literally what I’m doing (watching my comfort show eating take out) or something super extravagant. 

So what are y’all up to this weekend?",0
Is it weird to have only one pair of sunglasses?,"I'm a middle-aged guy, and I realized most of the guys around me, the typical suburban dads, have sporty sunglasses, in a few different styles, but all I ever use is a pair of black aviators.

Feeling really guilty about declining hanging out because it’s too late for me,"So my coworkers almost every week invite everyone to their place (like 10 people) after work which happens to be 10:30 at night. 

I’ve gone a couple of times and had a good time both times but also felt like shit the next day because I usually am in bed by 11. Anyway, they invited me last week and it was last second so I said no because I was about to go to bed when they asked. Now they invited me again to hang out with everyone Sunday after work but I don’t even work that day so I would just be waiting around alllll day long until they are out of work so I can head over there, have a decent time, and get a small amount of sleep before my morning shift right after.

This is why I’m so hesitant to go but I know if I say no again, I won’t get invited anymore and it’s also like, when else is there a chance for everyone to hang out outside of work? Never because we are all there 5 days a week. 

Should I feel guilty? What do you think about all of this? Can’t stop overthinking it and honestly I don’t want to go but I would also regret not going",0
Whats your preference - cold brew or Hot Coffee during the summer?,I like to drink cold brew during the summer months and hot coffee when it gets cold.

Advice for someone who is about to move to another continent?,"I’m about to move to Europe for study. I was pretty chilled a while back then, but now, 3 weeks left, I’m sitting in my room with piles of clothes, so many stuff to fit in my 2 big luggages (and a cabin one), tons of things still need to do, and suddenly I get that anxiety feeling. I still have a small issue with my resident card at the new country, and if I’m lucky things would be solved just right before my flight, so finger cross and anxiously waiting for that too. I guess I just wanna hear some random and non-serious advice on relocating matters. Like, what NOT to pack, what I should expect for first day, etc. I’m also back to school after 10 years, so, feel pretty weird being a student now. But I need this career break to “find myself again” haha 
For some context: 
- I’m living in Southeast Asia with a weather like 30-33 Celsius degree all the time, and now I’ll move to Northern Europe, with the infamous cold weather and (almost) unbearable darkness. I’m both excited about and looking forward to it, really. I traveled to Central & South Europe during spring time before, but it was pretty warm (10-12 Celsius) and basically everything was such a lovely experience. 
- it’ll be kinda like my first experience both living truly alone, and away from family. I’ve been always with family, sometimes with ex, but never alone. 
- it’ll also be my first experience living abroad. Even though I have an extensive international experience through work (mostly with western people, especially Europe. And I should mention that I’ve been working for a Scandinavian company for the past 5 years) and personal (friends & relationships), I am sure that actual life abroad will be very different. 
I’ll be there for at least 2 years, then I’ll see. I’ve been learning their language for 3-4 years, not seriously though, and will do later once I arrived. I do want to settle there and have a “future”, but it really depends, we will never be able to predict future, won’t we. I do know a good very friend there, and we plan to do some travel before I start my study, so, I am also very excited about that. Just, currently, feels a bit surreal about the move, I guess, it’s a big step, after all. 
Thank you in advance!",0
Well I'm moving to another school ...,"I don't know if I'm just self centered, but I feel like I'm just an insignificant being in the class where even if I disappear nobody would care and just move on to another normal day.

Should I buy this udemy course?,"There is 1 udemy course about simulation.

Although it costs 13$, it's not less amount of money for me and I've been given only 100$ for purchasing course. I generally purchase courses which are too good to not buy (and not available online).

My current situation is confusing-:

- this current course is no way, ""too good to not buy""

- this isn't available in any torrents or sth.

- I've very less time for exam, so if I start to learn everything by reading textbooks, I won't finish properly everything.

-I've studied till chapter 3 according my course, I haven't found a single good video in youtube. Forget video, I've not found even textbooks for it(and ofc no pdfs). It looks like the first few chapters aren't taught to majority.

-I personally feel there is more information for discrete system simulation. But I've not searched youtube yet. And there's no way to know if the videos are good without watching them seriously.

- The reviews of that course aren't giving any hints to me. Most reviews are 1* because they didn't understand his language. I can understand that language very easily. His audio quality is good.

- I've watched the preview, I didn't hated it, and I know the preview isn't ONE OF THE BEST, it is the same regurgitated materials collected from what's available online.

- If anyone here is studying in clz with helpful professors, I'm not from one of those colleges. You can assume that I don't have any teachers/TAs to ask if I get confused. The course will have added benefit of getting to ask question(You might say ""ask in forums"" but let's be honest, has anyone ever got a help in academics by asking in a forum or sub? forums are more for those who've already learnt how to do their homework and trying to learn sth extra stuffs).

-Hence, I'm very confused whether to buy this course or not. Please give me some advice.

I need to make decision within 2hrs as the price of course will become 100$+ afterwards, and will take 1 week to decrease price again if it does.",0

I found a book so engaging I can not read it. Have you ever experienced something like this?,"A while back I picked up The Vagrant trilogy by Peter Newman. The book is interesting, it takes place in a post-demon-apocalypse world. The main character does not speak, ever (as far as I got). You get no internal monologue, nothing but his actions. The book is great, the descriptions are good, and it is really engaging.

The bad part is if I read it I can't get restful sleep. As soon as my mind starts to fall into a dream the world of the book goes crazy, it is like my mind goes into hyper-speed.

Has anyone else experienced this? I've only gotten this way after DMing D&D before.",0

Do you still wear your mask,"Hey y’all. Today I was going on a walk my morning walk as usual. While walking an old guy said from a distance “isn’t it hot in that thing it’s already 80”. At first I said “yeah” just to acknowledge his presence and I didn’t know what he meant as I just woke up and it was like 7AM. As I was walking I realized he was referencing my mask. I wear my mask daily whenever I’m outside and on walks I wear it underneath my chin so if someone comes by I can just lift it up or if I’m walking into a store I can lift my mask up. 

To be honest I didn’t know why he said that? Cause what I wear isn’t any of his business and lately a lot of my friends, clients etc have been catching COVID too. So I don’t think COVID is dead. Idk man I felt weird about him. Unfortunately I’m not seeing many masked up in my area. Are you wearing your mask?

It’s not wrong to wear a mask right? Cause I’m just confused. How would you respond if someone asked you/commented on why your wearing a mask? Thanks",0
Topic: Tipping Point (I think),"At what point would you say that there are too many people in a room? 

To say that you care about one person, the same way you care about 1,000 people is not always accurate. It is far more exhausting to care for 1,000 people and no matter how loving of a person you are, the stress can take a toll on a person over time.

I've always been impressed by those who can hold a positive perspective and personality with everyone they come across. Let it be in a public setting or private setting. Not only can they remain in tact, but they do it without ever showing their stress, at least not to me.

Everyone has the choice to participate in a game of civility where we all get along and support one another by being nice and considerate of others, or not. This includes regular greetings, invitations to public gatherings, random reasons for celebration, etc.

I am pretty bad at playing this game for long periods of time, before I say ""I quit. There are millions of people out there, they were fine before me, they will be fine after me. So, I quit."" I am bad because I am comfortable being on my own. I don't feel like I'm better than others, but it definitely can come off that way.

Knowing about the tipping point, playing the game and never giving up; this is what it means to be human. To be a part of a civilization. This is what helps humanity move forward.

I lost a friendship and I am okay,"I feel like I need to get this off my chest. It might be the insomnia speaking but:


I got engaged in February (Im the bride). Everything was great and wonderful….until is wasn’t.  With my friend, that is. 

I am having an immediate family only ceremony - with a party to celebrate with my friends a month later. And I have been SO excited to celebrate with all of my friends. 

But then I had a close friend get weird. And ultimately, I found out it was because I didn’t ask her to be my maid of honor. I never promised her that. But she was hurt and so she has lashed out, and she lashed out hard. To the point of saying unforgivable things. 

All this to say: I had been wondering about us: she was a best friend. But our values do NOT like up - I miss her dearly. There have been times throughout our 6 year friendship where it has been very toxic. To the point of me being on su*cide watch because of the awful things that she has said. I miss her. But I know it’s best.

I just really love Kirby :D,"With the announcement of the new game, I find myself searching up Kirby on instagram and Twitter just to see new tweets and pictures and art people are posting. I've been seriously collecting Kirby merchandise for about 4 years now, my first video game as a toddler was Kirby 64 so I have always had a great love for Kirby. It was solidified some time in my teen years that Kirby would always be my ""thing"" (the term ""Disney adult"" comes to mind, just swap Disney with Kirby).

&#x200B;

It just warms my heart every time I see him. The new game announcement video was sent to me by about 4 separate people, because everyone in my life knows I love Kirby. I even took one of my Kirby plushes with me to work today to hold while I was at my desk :) He brightens my day up so much and I really love him.

I love the relationship that i have with my parents,"I know that reddit is filled with posts about toxic parents and such, but i'm gonna be honest, i love my parents, couldn't be more grateful for them. They were never married, they broke up when i was 3, and they were both very young when i was born (mom 21, dad 20.) So much could've gone wrong, and yes, it wasn't perfect, but hey, it all shaped who i am today.

Anyways, i just turned 17 yesterday, and although my dad is in a business trip, he still texted right as it turned midnight, and videocalled me in the morning so i'd get to see him. Next day was pretty great, i went karting with some mates and then i came back home for some dinner with mom, stepdad, and the family of my godmother, whom tbh, they're pretty much another mom, dad and a sister, i love them so much. Specially my sis because i don't have any, she is the closest thing to a sister that i have. 

As i opened the few presents that i got, my mom's/stepdad's was a bottle of whiskey and my godmother's was a letter saying to check my bank account. But the bottle of whiskey that my mom gave me really showed that she trusted me and that we have a very nice relationship. She knows that i drink alcohol, and she knows that i have got wasted a few times in parties, but she also knows that even tho i have got wasted before, i love mixology and alcohol as a science, and that bottle showed that she trusted me. We all had a glass of it and closed the night there, but honestly i couldn't ask for better parents. They were always thoughtful, caring and loving, and i couldn't love them more.

The whiskey is a Buchanan's Deluxe if you wanna know btw",0
What are you guys' consensus on people with tattoos?,"What do you assume about people with them? Do you have any? Do you regret them? What's some advice that you would give to someone related to this?

This has got me thinking about how other view tattoos, so here I am asking! 

Personally my only opinion on it is that I'd never get one on my hand, neck, or face. Face tattoos seem little much to me and hand tattoos seem like they'd fade away too easy so they wouldn't be worth it to get.",0

"Today, I stand up for myself for the first time.","For 27 years of my life, I've been a good person and followed my parents footsteps. I always do good things because I don't want to disappoint them. Last year I decided to take a step and get a job far away from them. They are still fussing about it till this day.

My mom always plays the ""Mom card"" all the time when she needs me to do things that she want eg. Give her money because I'm a daughter. (Yep, I'm Asian) While she spent all the money on gambling and paying debt.  I don't recognize her saying I'm beautiful in my lifetime. All I heard was 'You're fat, you have to lose weight.' or 'No one would wanna date you' and she always criticize my choice of clothes. Even when I wear short she said I have big thighs or when I wear tight pants she said I look fat. It's hurt to hear and annoying at the same time. 

Today I come back home to visit my grandma and I wear a backless bodysuit with long sleeves. First thing my mom great me after not seeing me for 2 months was 'This look embarrassing, how could you wear this? Go change it now. I don't like it'

But this time, this time I didn't follow what she said. Instead I tell her 'If you don't like what I wear, you better get use to it now. Because I like it and I'm not gonna change.'

"In Star Wars, all philosophies lose what they value most, in practice","I just thought this was some interesting irony, don't know if anyone else has thought about it.

The Jedi value spirituality, being one with the galaxy, but in denying their humanity, they lose touch with themselves and others. In trying to serve everyone but themselves, they often end up serving no one.

Sith value power, but ironically lose their vitality rapidly by using the dark side, and they often damage themselves to obtain it. It's not really power that they gain in exchange, it's more like a drug, like how caffeine makes you think you're not tired but doesn't truly provide energy.

And those who recognize the flaws in both, and choose not to take sides, end up accomplishing nothing because they're experiencing choice paralysis/apathy.

In a sense, being any of them and feeling the force is just a curse. Star Wars, like all fairy tales, has a darker or more unfortunate undertone than they initially appear (which is partially why I think Disney can do Star Wars justice, because they specialize in dark fairy tale movies)",0
I’m very confused on what is considered short and long hair for women and men,"Ok so when a woman has shoulder length hair that is considered short hair yes? But if a guy has shoulder length hair everyone says that his hair is so long. It is not long it is shoulder length that is short

Why is this? It is so clear to me but no one else agrees

Ok so buzzed to around shoulder length is short. And then like collar bone to arm pit is middle length. And then beyond that is long

See you think this is not a problem but see what has happened with shoe sizes. We separated them into mens and women’s. I want to be like “size 7” and it’s just ok this is size 7

See this will create huge problems you just wait and see.

"One year ago, I was lost. Now, probably thanks to a stranger I am living a completely different life, with a sense of myself.","A year ago, I was in grad school and working on applications to veterinary school. I had already decided months before that I honestly didn't want that. I had just told my family that I no longer wanted vet school. I didn't know what to do. I had a stable in-school job working as a bartender but never knew what could be next. I wanted to be a vet for 10 years. I wanted to be a vet or so I thought. So now, I was left with no path in a program that was set to get me there.

A few weeks later, my relationship fell apart and I left for one of my favorite places alone. I took a 14-hour trip solo to just escape and be by myself and my thoughts. Things were hitting the fan and I felt so distraught and I was already in my second week of school. On the first day, I wandered and did everything I could in the town I had visited. That night, I went to a restaurant and sat at the bar. Then a girl showed up, sat right next to me, and started chatting a little here and there. The next thing, I knew we were talking for hours. Me, the bartender, and the girl I just met non-stop talking on a Tuesday night about life. One of the things that struck me was that she was only a little older than I was. She was traveling and living for herself. She was being selfish in a healthy way. I never did that. She just talked and talked to me about literally everything. Eventually, she asked if I felt like doing something crazy and driving another few hours to drive on some trails. At first, I was very cautious because I was alone and scared to go even further away by myself. After a lot of talking, she convinced me to just take that chance and experience things because I never knew what may happen the next day. I've heard that phrase before but something coming from her felt really different. So, I decided I was going to leave the next morning and drive to a scenic area with beautiful trails that was hours away and sleep in my truck just to do it. Before I left, she made me promise to live my life the way I wanted to and did what made me happy.

Two weeks later, I dropped out of grad school to pursue art and bartend. I didn't look back. Now, a year later I'm in a completely different city. I am now in a place for bartenders to grow in such a healthy way. I have felt nothing but support and love since I dropped out of grad school. The place I am in now provides me with a bright bright future in the industry where I found a passion for bartending. Funny that a year ago, I was stressing about how can I possibly use my degree, and now here I am, not even touching anything related to it. I have a long way to go but I am following my heart and passion. I am much happy and feel more full than before. Thank you, Marie. You pushed me this way and now, I am different person.",0
How can I stop being a people pleaser and being too nice?,"I would like to know how I can stop being a people pleaser and being too nice. I am way to nice too nice to people. I allow people to disrespect me, walk all over me, and put me down. I'm a doormat and I have a hard time standing up to people and speaking my mind when people are doing things I don't like.

When someone does or says something I don't like sometimes I won't say anything and I will build up anger about what happened. I have a hard time expressing how I feel in that moment. I feel like I care more about other people's feelings than my own. I am way to nice to other people and allow them to mistreat me. I put up with way to much of other people's stuff.",0
I'm very excited for my new computer,"I ordered my first custom built gaming PC on Saturday and I've been checking the production status about 40 times a day ever since, I know it's gonna be at least another week most likely but I just keep checking.

Happy Budget!,"After years of just keeping a budget in my head I finally made one in excel a few months ago. I made three transcation logs for my bank, credit and crypto cards and then made a dashboard to track categories by month and then by year along with the monthly budget. I was shocked that after a few months of finding places to cut back we managed to find $437.89 (so far) a MONTH of wasteful spending! We mainly cut back subscription services, eating out, and less wasteful grocery shopping (main savings). With the savings we will pay off a car loan 1 1/2 years early freeing another $250 a week! For a total of $1437.89 ""freed"" up by just making a budget and small cut backs. 

I'm honestly shocked at the amount saved. I can start making triple payments on my home now without changing my lifestyle! Just wow!",0

How do you guys show that you care about someone? {Love Languages},"A while back I got to attend a presentation from a classmate on 'Love Languages'. I found it very interesting as it was separated into 5 categories:

I noticed today that everyone is bothered by people looking at them.,"We are so obsessed with our devices that the Meer act of looking at someone in a restaurant causes panic. I was sitting in a Starbucks today waiting to go to my job and I wasn't using my phone. I know shocking. Well two little girls were being annoying by doing acrobatic moves in the middle of the store. I watched them for a short time and thier mom got uncomfortable. (I'm a woman) I then looked over and watched the baristas making drinks for a bit. One looked at me then said something in to his drive thru mic and the other baristas looked at me.


Either I'm a troll or looking at people is now frowned upon.

These are the things that bother me the most about Reddit. What bothers you?,"* It revolves around herd behavior: what you are going to see, read, watch... everything is determined by the herd.
* Voting behavior is not solely derived from actual personal opinions, but also by the herd mentality, as [this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/clg6m9/comment_voting_and_herd_mentality/) showed with an experiment: write two comments, a good one people will upvote, and a bad one people will downvote - after getting a number of votes, edit and swap the comments, people will be manipulated to continue on the herd flow: downvoting the good comment and upvoting the bad comment.
* Users are conditioned to interact in search of votes and acceptance by the herd.
* It uses psychological traps to make users addicted, to manipulate emotions, influence opinions... (like most social media today).
* If you get late to a discussion, it’s often pointless to comment: if you comment early, there are more chances your voice will be heard and you’ll get more interaction. After a certain number of answers, all the other comments will get less and less visibility to the point they become irrelevant. The first best upvoted comments will usually hold the monopoly of the discussion, even if other posters have better points.
* Lynching: you know when one person attacks someone on the street, and all of a sudden there is a crowd attacking in a mindless behavior? This happens a lot here. We can’t be educated about every subject, so when users look at a some post with many downvotes, they are induced to think that’s wrong, which generates a domino effect of attacks. The opposite is also true with upvotes.
* Disposable discussions that will hardly last more than one day. They will all be buried in the timeline and nobody will ever touch it again (or rarely).
* Censorship: too much limitation on free speech, unfair moderators and dumb filters.",0

I truly cannot stand seeing previously free or one-time purchase services moving to a subscription model.,"So many apps, services, programs, add-ons, plugins, etc  have moved to a subscription model that requires a continuous payment for use or access to the full features. It feels like a concerted effort by companies to move from a customer-oriented experience to a profit-oriented one and I hate it. I feel there's not nearly enough pushback happening to this, which is why more and more companies are empowered to make this move and for increasingly absurd things like using your car's remote start or heated seats that should be included in the purchase.

There's got to be more effort on the part of customers to get across that this is a flagrant middle finger in pursuit of profit and has drastically diminished the quality of services and features that were previously provided or included in the initial price of purchase. So many apps now only give you a single free feature then demand annual payment for the rest of their basic features which are now somehow considered premium??

I have been reading books ever since i was a little kid, and i used to love doing it. I actually consider myself a bit fortunate because my parents did not introduce me to the internet until 4th grade. They bought me a lot of books to read instead, and it's a big part of the reason why my English speaking, vocabulary, and skills are so good today (compared to other subjects) i could easily finish of a 200 page book in two days with the most intense concentration.

But...

Ever since 10th grade, I have lost touch with this habit. Man, i cant even remember the last time i got absorbed into a book. I barely read 20 pages without getting exhausted and giving up.

An online friend I haven't heard anything from in over 4 years messaged me,"So there was this friend I had met many years ago on Geometry Dash (happened probably at least 6 years ago) and we were pretty close, talked almost every day, even called on Skype a couple times.

Anyways, a little over 4 years ago he pretty much just went dead silent, not a word, last thing that happened was he left me read on Instagram I think.

Being that this was so long ago, I stopped caring a while back, so that doesn't even bother me. Strangely enough though, after all this time, I got a message from him on Instagram maybe a couple weeks ago (same account so I doubt it was a scammer or something). After all these years of silence, and it was just a simple ""Yo"" to start. Well, alright. I decided I'd respond, so I said hello back, as you do to a greeting. Once again, just left me on read. Doesn't bother me, but *why* message someone after so long if you're not going to engage with them?

I just ended up blocking him because I really don't care anymore, I haven't been losing sleep over it or anything. Not looking for advice here, I'm content with never talking to him again (that was what I've been doing these last several years) but I am curious, has anyone else had a similar situation happen with them and a friend? What would you have done in my situation?

And additionally, has anyone ever been in the opposite end? Have you contacted someone after a long time, like he did with me? If so, why, and how did it go?

**TL;DR:** If someone stops talking to you without any explanation for several years, starts a conversation, and then once again ignores you, what would you do? Or on the opposite side, have you ever been the one to contact someone after you've done this?",0

Going to the doctor again for mental health reasons,"Last time I endured it for way too long and things escalated. I regretted that I didn’t get help sooner. 

So now that I’m seeing early signs of possible escalation, I’m taking a step back and get some time off. Absolutely no one will give you a gold medal for enduring something. It’s not worth it. So it’s best to just look out for yourself and remove yourself from a situation that’s damaging to you.

I still feel a little guilty and pathetic though. Because it was less than a month ago, since I called in sick and now I’m doing it again. But then again, I’ll stop turning this into a challenge as in “for how long am I able to endure this until I break down?” That’s just stupid.

What about an app to deposit coins???,"Hear me out. Wouldn't it be nice to have a feature on bank apps that allows you to deposit coins? Like if you accumulate coins, quite like we can deposit cheques by sending a picture, we do the same for coins. The amount would go to a sort of ""temporary"" account and once a month, we go to our banks and prove that we have this amount. Now, if we spent the money in some way, we only get what the actual total amount of the coins is. For eg, if you ""deposit"" $20 in the bank but spend $5 on a snack, you'll only get $15 actually deposited in your account. Just an idea that some friends and I were thinking of the other day when one of us had a lot of coins but didn't find time to go to the bank to deposit them. I feel like there might be a lot of difficulties in doing this, but I can't really explain what. What do you think of that?",0
Reminding myself of my failures has helped me be happier.,"Last year, I applied for the college of my dreams to study classical guitar. I had been preparing for that exam for the last two years and, meanwhile, I lost valuable friendships and opportunities to take workshops I was really interested in. This was in high school, and I saw many of my classmates succeed in every other national event or some internal competition. I even saw my guitar colleagues winning important events and overall playing better than me. All those years I comforted myself by saying that, by being patient and preparing myself for that exam, I would succeed in something more important than any competition my colleagues won. Because of thins, being very unpopular and having just a few people talk to me didn’t bother me much, though I now admit that it saddened me a lot whenever I thought about it. This not only made me feel alone, but also conformist and arrogant, as by reminding myself that I would succeed in something better and that I had been studying for that exam for a long time, I was sure that I would pass the exam even though I did not study much.
Naturally, I didn’t pass and it completely broke me. One of the first things that came through my mind was that I wasted my high school years but, more importantly, I was not the person I thought I was. The sole idea of studying abroad gave sense to my life and held my self esteem up. I realized then that it was all for nothing, and I came to grips with what I feared the most: all of my classmates, guitar colleagues and friends had done greater things than me; I was indeed an uninteresting student that did the bare minimum to finish high school.
For the next months (i.e. last winter) I stopped playing guitar completely and did some reflection. I repeatedly told myself: “You are not that good”. I became insecure and fearful of making any more mistakes that would affect me the way this did. By the end of last year, I started missing a lot playing guitar, and my shift of mentality made me be quite cautious of playing again, as I came to the clear conclusion that something was fundamentally wrong with my playing, because otherwise I would have passed the exam. I took another week off playing but I researched a lot into different guitar players, teachers giving masterclasses and technique books. One day, it all suddenly clicked: I had found the principle behind all the recommendations I had seen and thus had a clear path to restart my playing in the right direction. I was for once pretty happy and started practicing again. Together with my happiness came immediately the idea that “I was not that good” and it consequently lowered my expectations. For some time the story repeated itself in every activity I did: I got exited for doing something better and I immediately calmed down.
It has been almost a year since then and I sometimes forget the failures I’ve had, but when I make a mistake, the same phrase comes up again “You are not that good”. Having adapted this mindset in my life, I now know that everything I do, I do it because I like it. That’s it. Not because I want to be the best at it. Whenever I see that I perform better than someone, I become fearful again, because I remember that the other person and is probably much better than me, and certainly a lot of people are miles better at what I do. And when I bring myself back from the temporal pride of being better, I enjoy things again.

how to you deal with constant stream of setbacks and rejections?,"I'm just going to say it first that it's hard staying positive and motivated all the time.

A bit of background:

- I got rejected/ghosted from 300++ job applications.
- My ~~two~~ 3 startups that I spend a big chunk of my time and money in the last 3 years, failed big time.
- Never been in a relationship and im almost 30.
- Had to withdraw my professional cert exam which is due in a month because I'm choked full of commitments to carve out time to study. (few hundred bucks burned).

Naming is one of the hardest thing I have ever encountered.,"Some years ago my nephew was born. My brother asked me to suggest him a name for his newborn daughter.

After a lot of thinking the best name could came up with was Krankenwagen. 
I told him it’s a good name, it means ambulance in German.

My poor naming skill never bothered me but recently I am working with a tech startup. We are developing a Productivity Software, they let me choose the name I am struggling for 3 days to find a good name.

Do yo also struggle with naming? 
If not how do you approach naming and can you suggest me one?",0
I have what may be the best weekend of the summer ahead of me and I am so excited,"It’s currently 2AM and I can’t sleep and this is what’s on my mind so figured I’d tell some people about it.

For the context, I (21M) am home from school from the summer but have to go back this weekend to move everything out of my place up at school. While that’s the official reason I’m going back, it’s not why I’m so excited.

There’s this girl I like. Like, really like. One quick look at my profile and you’ll see I’ve been caught up on her for a good little while. We saw each other a couple times towards the end of the school year, I took her out to lunch a couple times, invited her over to my place where I cooked her dinner and we watched some movies. Good stuff.

The sad part however was that we were both going home for the summer. At this point I had already decided I really liked her and didn’t want to wait or leave things to luck. We’ve been texting a lot all summer long, just about daily. We’ve seen each other twice since summer started, the first time was so-so but the second time was really nice and we spent some good time together.

This weekend should be fun. I asked her what her plans were and she said she had none aside from lunch with friends, and if I learned anything from last time that means she’s more than happy to spend time with me.

Friday night will start off with a visit to the local cat cafe. She’s a huge cat freak and it’s one of the things we connect on the most (my cat is adorable and she loves her) so I’m really excited for that. My sister has only said good things about cat cafes so I’m thinking she will love it. 

After that is dinner at this really cool food hall with lots of options. I have no idea if she’s been before so I don’t know what she’ll go for. The past couple times I’ve gone I’ve gone to the hamburger stand but this time I’ll probably get a little more creative. I’ll make sure we take our time looking at all of the options and get something good. That food hall is downtown so maybe we’ll walk around for a little bit and see what’s going on.

After that is the really fun part though. The plan is to go back to my place and watch Mamma Mia, one of her favorite movies. I know nothing about the movie, but I like ABBA so I’m sure I’ll get something out of it. The goal here is to really get comfortable with her and finally kiss her. I feel like we’ve spent too much time together that I’m afraid she’s wondering why I haven’t kissed her yet. We’ll see how that goes and go from there for as far as Friday night is concerned.

Saturday has not been thought out nearly as well but I’m sure it’ll work out. She’s kinda a big marvel nerd so when she first told me she’d be in town that weekend I immediately went and ordered two tickets for the new Thor movie. She ended up seeing it last weekend with her family but when I told her afterwards that I had bought those tickets and could refund them she said she’d be happy to see it again.

Then today we were talking and joking about half birthdays and I told her we had to celebrate hers because that’s this Friday. She’s a big fan of baking so I suggested we make some half birthday cupcakes and she seemed to love that idea so I’ll have to figure out when we can do that. 

I really like this girl and hope that I can move us forward this weekend and let her know how I feel because just talking to her like she’s a friend is starting to drag on me. Either way though I’m excited to spend time with her.

And I guess because this post is about the weekend I have to mention that I’ll be seeing one of my best friends for the last time before he moves all the way across the country. We’ll likely check out this really cool disc golf course that neither of us have been to before. We won’t be spending too much time together because admittedly the girl is priority number 1, but he knows that and knows how much I’ve dedicated into getting to know this girl better so he’s cool with it. I also visited him at his home last weekend along with a bunch of other friends so that was kinda his last send off.

No matter what happens I’m sure this will be my best weekend of the summer and I’m really looking forward to it. The only problem now is I have to remember to actually pack up my stuff and get my place cleaned up before I leave…",0

Does anyone else feel like their soul is tired?,"Couple of important distinctions: I'm not sad, I enjoy plenty of things in my life, happily married, decent job that doesn't consume my life. 

But

I have an intense desire to isolate myself from all other people. I just can't bring myself to care about what's going on anywhere anymore. Id much rather be fishing. 

I fly fish, almost exclusively rivers, with waders. I never keep anything, and use barbless hooks. There's a specific peace I find in those moments, standing in the river, that I feel like I'm finally home. Like there's a warmth in that 45° water I can't find anywhere else. Like a very specific bell is finally being rung in my heart. 

Nothing else matters except just being in nature. 

Can anyone relate?",0

Anyone else prefer the food they cook by themselves over restaurant/fast-food places?,"During the pandemic, when I had to stay by myself in one of our houses, I had no one to cook for me. A lot of restaurants were close. At that time, food delivery wasn't accessible in our area and it's quite expensive to live like that anyway. Disclaimer here is: I am not a good cook. Most people won't even consider me a good cook at all. 

However, the pandemic forced me to learn how to cook. I quickly  got tired of bread, canned goods and instant noodles. I started cooking fancier dishes. Most of them were korean. Some were Filipino food. It wasn't just fry and dine kind of thing. I always make sure I eat some greens in a day. I watched a lot of youtube videos on cooking.

Over time, more than a year since the pandemic started, I have discovered that I prefer my own cooking over take-out. I don't know. Maybe because I can adjust the taste. Fastfood is always too salty for my taste. Restaurant food has unexpected unfamiliar flavors sometimes. 

I think it may have something to do with control? Like I know what I'm craving. I know what kind of food I want but it's not just that. I know exactly what I want in my meals and I can make them.",0

That's my dog!,"So my sister, niece and daughters went on a road trip this past weekend for a wedding and we like to play this car game where if you see an animal out the window you yell ""that's my (cow, horse, dog, etc)"" and that's your animal. After a day of travel this is practically instinct to yell out and so when we were driving past an empty lot and my sister sees a tiny dog rooting around a trash bin she immediately yells ""that's my dog!"". There's nobody nearby and so many sister asks if we should check it out and I say yeah so we pull in and I open the door and start calling up to this small dog (like a mix between a dachshund and a Jack Russell terrier) and she walks right up to the car door and lets me give her scratches and check her very tight harness for tags, which there are none.

 So then we have this dilemma of what to do, we're in an unfamiliar city far from home but we can't just leave this dog here so I pick her up and she immediately snuggles up on my lap and we decide to knock on doors nearby which yields no one who knows where this dog is from. We call around to find out that the humane society had recently been shut down in that city and that there were a lot of animals misplaced due to fires that had recently required the city to be evacuated. So we joined the local Facebook lost pet groups and post her there but eventually decide she's going to come with us back home. And over that 4 hour drive we all immediately fall in love with her. Once home we took her to the vet to check for a microchip and there was no microchip or spay scar, so that helped ease some of the guilt of the possibility of just taking somebody's dog.

 And I just had to tell somebody because now she has a pillow and toys and a kennel and is not relying on trash bins for food and I think it's so funny that are silly road trip game turned out so literal.",0

Do you ever wonder what you're doing or what's happening in the moment would be talked about among your grandchildren,"I'm 18m, a kid or a young adult and I hear a lot of stories of my late grandfather, stuff about his hobbies like rifle collecting, loving and working on his car anr motorcycle; a few thoughtful things he did for my grandma and his parents and siblings; stuff like that. A lot of the stories are from when he was a teen or in his 20s. 

Sometimes I wonder if stuff I'm doing now would be talked about in the future like I am a great person or something. I also love driving, I work on my parent's cars, I have an interest in cooking and though I can't do much I help my grandma, aunts and my mom in the kitchen especially during the holidays. I try to be a good person, I try to do good by others and try not to be the villian in someone's story because I like being able to sleep at night (call me innocent and stupid if you want to). 

I have also done brave, stupid and wild stuff and got injured in the process (many times) and I wonder if that would be talked about. There's definitely stuff I don't want people to even know like I struggle with ptsd, depression and I get panic attacks and my family doesn't know for good reason. I like it that way and I don't want anyone to know",0
The Destiny puzzle,"I’ve been left fried and cynical after a frustrating 14 months. Anything that could go wrong went wrong. 

I’m not talking about a major loss but a pattern of absolutely nothing working out. Either all things fail or take a whole lot of extra effort to get done because of issues well outside my control – be it a new job offer that doesn’t come through after months of delays/ deals failing for no reason / literally basic paper work which normally should be done automatically but now warrant a lot of work and travel/ etc.

The last 1 year+ has been fraught with delays/impediments/ especially failure at the 99% level.

many say “things happen for a reason“. I’ve never subscribed to that belief but at this point I wonder if the statement holds some value. 

The last one year has taught me that there are so many things out of my control which could go wrong and have all gone wrong. Yes, there were a couple of things which I had control over and made an error.

What are your thoughts? Are we truly at the mercy of external forces to some level?",0
Do social skills actually diminish during periods of isolation?,"When I was in high school interacting w/ ppl daily, I was very comfortable w/ conversations; was confident in what I had to say w/ quick, clever responses.

Since starting online uni, the only ppl I interact w/ are the pharmacists at my drugstore 1x/month. I have zero friends since leaving high school. It’s been this way for 3yrs now. 

Now, when I’m faced w/ an in-person conversation, I stand there not knowing what to say as they stare at me awaiting a response. It is unbearably awkward. It’s like I’m just stuck in my head.

You’d think that once you’ve acquired basic social skills, you retain them for life, like riding a bike? Have I *actually* just “lost” them, and can be gained back, or is there something wrong with me? Lol.",0
"Competition Isn't real, is it?","I came to the realisation that the concept of competition is all in my head... 
In ecology (whatever i remember from my 12th grade classes), competition means both parties loose something right?
I just recently started working, and have come to realise that the concept of competition was created to keep everyone on their toes! As long as I'm content with where I am and what I'm doing, I won't care what another dude is doing or how much greater or more valued than me he/she is.
I think the concept of jealousy arose from competition, and at this point in human society, we should drop the whole competition thing, and actually start being content! (I also realise that this is a pipe dream, but a bit of wishful thinking never hurt anyone before, right?)

What do y'all think? 
The ecological side of it makes sense, because we use it as a parameter to see where evolution took us (again, weak grasp on ecology... Feel free to correct me! I'd love to learn more). But the same shouldn't apply to humans, because we're supposed to figure out competition Isn't great for mental health!

I have a long time friend and I considered her my best friend but realized I can't match her wavelength. Should I let her go?,"She has been my best friend before senior high school.

We were partners in quizbee contests and we where classmates in senior high and yet I feel like it doesn't feel right. Like I'm struggling to match her strides.

During the quarantine, we never talked but I think the friendship is still there. I think. We meet when our circle of friends celebrate Christmas or birthdays but still, it's so different. I know I fit well with my two other friends but it doesn't feel right with her. And when we met coincidentally on a festival, she's with her other friends and that's when I saw the difference. Why we don't match. Her posts on social media also feels like I can't relate even though I really know what she's talking about.

"I get it now. The reason you don't care what others think so much past a certain age, is because you go through too much to sweat the small stuff.","So I just had a small issue with my neighbour. Taking out bins at the same time, and I smiled and gave her a little wave, and she dramatically eye-rolled, tutted at me, and went in. I don't know what I've done. Maybe I was too loud at some point, maybe she's annoyed about my bin arrangement. I'm not sure. But after the past two years, including two grandparent deaths, a pet death, and fertility issues, where I would have stressed myself silly wondering what I did to her a couple of years ago, I find myself genuinely not caring. If she wants to be an adult and tell me what's up, I will do my best to help her out, but dear lord... Passive-aggressive neighbours are just so the least of my worries.

This isn't what I was hoping for in terms of the growth behind not giving a crap what people think any more, but I have to admit it is a small relief.",0

I recently overcame my fear of airplane turbulence (here's how!),"Since a young age, I've been incredibly nervous about airplane turbulence. I'm not necessarily scared of flying *overall* - I'm otherwise fine with all other aspects of flying - but the bumpy parts always turn me into a sweaty, nervous wreck. Rationally, I've always known that turbulence is normal, that our safety is never at a significant risk, and that it's just a temporary moment that passes, but I'm visibly disturbed each and every time it happens. It makes flying feel horrible, and it's not a great look for a fully grown adult.

On a recent flight, I noticed that my body would be super tense at the slightest signs of turbulence. My legs would be fully extended with my feet planted firmly on the floor, and my back pressed against the chair. So what if I directly addressed these physical symptoms by staying as loose and limber as possible?

**My solution: Dance party in your seat.** Bend and stretch your legs. Bend and stretch your arms. Roll your neck and shoulders. Just keep moving.

I found that constantly moving as many parts of my body as possible helped significantly reduce tension AND anxiety. Plus, staying constantly in movement was surprisingly adaptive to the bumps, dips, and shakes of the plane! I had a much wider range of motion to compensate for unexpected jolts, than I would if I stayed glued to my seat. I ended up alternating between chill podcasts during the smooth flying, and upbeat dance music during the bumpy parts.

I wanted to share this story in case this helps anyone else who experiences fears or anxieties related to airplane turbulence. Please share any stories you have about flying, or experiences you've had with overcoming fears or anxieties.",0

""um, so it means that the cat doesn't live with anyone and looks after itself. It's all by itself and sometimes you have to be careful because it won't want to be hugged or petted because it's used to being by itself and gets a bit scared, yno?""

Ponders for a moment. Licks his popsicle and says decidingly;

""You live by yourself, so you must be feral too""

""Yea. True.""",0

Fake friendships and social media show off.,"There was a group of friends and they would regularly post stories and statuses about friendship and shit and tell how much they care about their friends and all that. 

They were involved in some mess in school. A few were questioned and in 2 mins they turned on their other friends involving them in the mess. Pretty much everyone in the group was scolded and punished in some way. It is still unclear who was innocent or who was guilty. But it felt really ironic.",0
Did you leave your native country and stay gone? Why or why not?,Just curious why some people move across country to somewhere new and what made them do so. My husband and I have been thinking about moving lately but we don't know where we want to go.,0
Credit/Debit Card Number Changing,"    I’m asking because I feel I’m in a minority here. Do people regularly get new card numbers, like fairly often? My family and friends I’ve asked don’t and some have had the same card for years (my mom has had her same card for over a decade). 
    I always feel paranoid someone online has my card numbers because I feel not the hardest thing in the world nowadays, so I regularly change up my cards every month or couple of months. Just want to know if anyone else does this or if it’s weird to be so paranoid.",0
Now that Overwatch 2 has came out what are your thoughts on the two games so far,"Overwatch 1 is still a game I play every now and then.. But since Overwatch 2 is now out, is it better than the first game?? Why or why not? Even though I've heard some good and not so good things about the new game. I'm sure the first game of the series has its pros and cons too. But personally for me, I haven't gotten a chance to play the second game. But the first one I do find quite enjoyable, whether it's with some friends or solo.",0
Isn’t it wild that people have literal silver color growing in their hair and don’t think that’s the most beautiful thing in the world. Like girl you look like money. It’s like having golden hair. Appreciate that. We demonize aging so much that we ignore any beauty in it.,"And not saying that people should *have* to love their gray/silver hair, just that we should all appreciate it more. We are taught to view aging (especially if we’re women) as bad, not beautiful, & the end of a dating life.",0

Let's talk music!,"Hi guys! I'm finally making my first post on this sub. It might not be original, but hey... it's something!

So I'm a huge fan of music, as in I love music no matter what genre it is, who the artist is - I'm really curious when it comes to that. If I like it when I listen to it, then it goes in my playlist. I listen to a lot of different genres, like hip-hop, rock, K-Pop and J-pop, basic pop; I'm a huge Billie Eilish fan, I love Doja Cat, I have the occasional Arctic Monkeys and Stones in my playlist, I like The Neighborhood, Lizzo, Olivia Rodrigo, Glass Animals... I love discovering new music!

I'm french and I've kind of hated what's been happening here right now, music-wise. There was nothing I liked, nothing that caught my attention. But Bigflo & Oli dropped a new album and it's... pretty great. I'm glad I gave it a listen.

That's all I wanna talk about. What do you guys like? What do you listen to? Give me recommendations! Let's talk about it!",0
"I made an absurdly long playlist with very short songs, all under 80 seconds long.","I was kinda bored, and started adding music from my collection with the shortest lenghts.

But then it got out of control, and now there are more than 1,000 songs in it.",0
My alarm clock just exploded.,"Er, ye. What the title states.

I tried to charge my alarm clock (yes it has a chargable battery) but since i didnt know where my mum had put the original charging cable for the alarm clock i just used my laptop charger since the ports looked similar. In hindsight that was dumb but i cant change the past so.

 It immediately had like a spark like explosion sound come from the alarm clock. Also im pretty sure something was blown off inside the clock as when i picked it up and shook it it sounded like smth was clattering inside. Oh and there was this nasty smell that reminded me of like a burnt carcass. Ye.

Do yall know if the smell is anything dangerous, cuz i really wanna make my last words something funny. Also i need a new alarm clock which is a bummer.",0
Does being successful means your mission in life has been accomplished?,"I am at a point where I question myself about life almost everytime,I dont know what being successful truly means? Does it mean that you have achieved your dream job, does it mean that you have money to spend on everything or does it mean being satisfied with what you have? If you consider yourself successful so does that mean your quest have been finished? Or the only general reason we humans are born is because we seek success and then die?",0
I'm in a rut and looking for a hobby/passion to take up. Suggestions welcome!,"**I (22M)** graduated college a year ago and am currently working a job where I travel across the Midwest, **living out of totes and backpacks and bouncing between AirBNB's**. My job is fine and it pays well, but it's just... meh most of the time. Don't get me wrong I understand how blessed I am to be here and the hard work I've put in has paid off.

I just wish things could be more interesting. I want that joy of childhood/early teenage years back when experiences were new, I was surrounded by peers, and daily life was fresh. I was talking to my sister yesterday and explaining that I **wake up** at 6AM, go to **work** until 5PM, hit the **gym** for an hour, come home **eat, shower, sleep** and **do it all again the next day-** I was almost tearing up. I miss having hobbies, friends, time, events, and things to look forward to.

I'm currently digging myself out of a rut I fell into with alcohol and nicotine where I would spend my free time wasting away on a couch. I regret it but I've learned from it. **I'm trying really hard to find things as a creative outlet.** It's been hard to have genuine interest for awhile and I'm not sure if it's part of growing old or the after-effects of alcohol. I've liked painting and woodworking in the past, but it's hard when you're constantly on the road in rental places. I left my bike back home because I wasn't sure if I would have a place to store it on the road. I have a laundry list of things I'd like to try to maybe get a spark back and feel something again. I've wanted to start a YouTube channel for years but never got any momentum.

I guess my question is: **What is your passion?** What creative outlets do you use? I'm looking for something to obsess over, something I can feel genuine interest in again.

**Ideas I've had (some I've tried over the years some are brand new):** Woodworking, Mountain biking, Working out, Painting, Yoga, Piano, Lego stop-motions, Programming, Chess, Pottery, Wood carving, Drone flying, Backyard farming/gardening, Meditation, Disc golf, Cooking, Rubik’s cube, Fishing, Interior design, Reading, Museums, Journaling, Video games, Darts, Astronomy, Poker",0
I'm in mid-20s nd haven't experienced much in life yet,"Like getting drunk wasted, going into mixers, bar hopping, late night outs, meeting interesting ppl. My closest friends are far away now, pursuing their careers, while me still stuck in here. Seriously my life is so boring right now. 
I feel like I'm wasting my youth( If you still call mid20s youth) 
I wish I'll get to experience all the fun things before my 20s end.",0
A dream that cured my anxiety and FOMO,"When I was younger I was so anxious to stay on top of things. At college, I'd drive myself crazy scrolling through social media. I was afraid to miss opportunities and I envied those, whom I thought had more exciting lives.

One day I had a dream about going to a theatre play. I was thrilled to see the performance. I had saved up money for months to buy a ticket. Everyone in town was talking about the new play. The day of the premiere came. I put on my best suit. But on the way to the theatre, I got stuck in a traffic jam. I abandoned the car and decided to run there. Some dogs started chasing me, barking, and biting. When I finally got to the theatre, I was all sweating and my wonderful suit was ripped off. They didn't let me in since the play had already begun. I pleaded and threw a tantrum but nothing helped. So I spent the whole play just listening to other people laughing and applauding through closed doors. I was so angry that *everyone except me* got to see the play. I burst into tears...

And that was the moment I woke up. For a few minutes, I was still upset about missing the play. I was also angry at all the other people, who saw the performance. Then I finally realized that since it was my own dream and I was creating the whole universe there was actually no performance and no other people to see it. I suffered for nothing because of persuading myself that there was something to crave.

I extrapolated the idea to the real world. What if my whole life is just a dream? What if it's an advanced simulation, like a computer game? If I'm the only player then I can be sure that no one else is having a better experience.

Since then my FOMO has declined. Now I don't feel sad even when alone on a Friday night. If I'm sitting in my room and doing nothing at the moment... well, then it's all that exists in the world right now, at least in my own world.

All our suffering comes from attachments and cravings. The only way to free yourself is to stop desiring and to stop treating the world like a real thing.",0
Age and gaming,"So I have made posts on verious places on reddit looking for people to play with and I must say I have a hard time finding people my age to play with (I'm 29). And sometimes I get comments from people telling me to grow up, like they know me and apparently gaming is all I do? And other times I just find these people that have a hard time even having a normal conversation while playing.
I guess I'm looking for some sort of help to find good people to play and talk with, any suggestionson how?
Thanks for reading. 🙂",0
Why don't we have a word for that?,"I stumbled across the word ""coopetition"" today -- a portmanteau of cooperation and competition. As far as neologisms go, this Frankensteinian mouthful has been around a while, having first graced our language with its tongue-clunk awkwardness in the early 20th Century. 

For those interested: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition)

Anyway, bilingual folks, I'd love to know of words outside of the English language that describe a state of cooperative competition.",0

I've heard someone say once that a city without record and book stores is practically dead inside and I tend to agree.,"Add to that comic shops, gaming shops, board game and RPG places, and of course, video libraries (I think there's only one left in my whole country)! Don't get me wrong, my city still has some book stores around, but every single one is a chain (that seems do be focused more on selling stationary and such) or a charity shop. No record stores. I'm about to move to a new city that has plenty of record stores and book stores, which is super cool, although the record stores are all LPs and I don't really have a record player so they're useless to me lol. Only the largest city in the country has all of these things around, they're super niche today.

I love the internet but I hate how it seemed to kill off the spaces in real life that are dedicated to culture, where you can potentially hang out and talk about fun stuff with your friends and with the clerks, get excited about the things you're going to get. Now it's all online, you can't get a job selling this sort of thing, and every time I need to physically go out shopping feels like a chore without those places. And the few places that do exist jack up their prices since they're so few of them there's no competition. Poorer cities can forget about them, at best they'd get an underfunded public library (no offence to libraries but it's a very different function in society I think).

I know I shouldn't idealize the past and so many of the Clerks in those places could be asshole gatekeepers a-la Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons, but still.. they just made me happy.

Do you think there's a universe where these sort of places can become commonplace again? [I read that there's a boom in book stores in the US now, which is cool](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/books/bookstores-diversity-pandemic.html).",0
How is your morning going? Mine has been a challenge,"I have been fighting to get my school bus license and I thought it was FINALLY done but nope, 11mos of work later the licensing needs more things that, yet again, no one bothered to tell me about.

This should be the last thing but I will say this: i don't want to drive a stupid bus anymore. So there.

"I cannot use giant eating utensils, can anyone else relate?","For some reason, I despise using large utensils, especially spoons.

I’ve been having intense dreams lately and I think they mean something.,"For most of my life I haven’t been one those people that has all these wild and vivid dreams, but a couple of times in my life it’s happened and there has almost always been some kind of meaning to them. 

Recently I have been having very intense dreams about facing, overcoming, or escaping some kind of grave danger and I think there is some deeper spiritual or psychological significance to them.

What is your definition of happiness?,"I tend to plan ahead in life and I somehow come up with the solution that having the things in life that lots of people strive for, such as a spouse, a family, a successful job, etc., will bring me long lasting happiness. But just imagining myself with those things makes me question whether or not that is true happiness. Maybe happiness is a temporary feeling whereas content is what most every strives for. 

Make no mistake, I’m not sad or depressed by any means! I just wonder what happiness truly is and what is it that humans strive for.

Family Problems,"This is just to rant a bit about my family, especially my dad. My dad will get upset at the smallest things and make me ask for forgiveness with tears only to say he was never really upset, THEN get upset for real because I was still crying. He acts like it is nothing but really it is slowly crippling my mental health.

One time we were at a restaurant and I just wasn't feeling happy in general, no real reason, that already ticks my dad off. One thing about me is that I will get long periods of time with no energy and my parents solution is to ""just be happy"" and I can't take it anymore. To go back on topic, when the food arrived mine came first and I had pasta, everyone else had their food and my two sisters were sharing so when one of their plates had not shown up yet I thought it was ok to eat, because the other sister had her food and they were splitting it 50/50 anyway.
 My dad did not like this at all and, not yelling because we were in public, but told me off for being brought up to only eat when everyone had their food and that he would have failed as a parent if he let me eat when one of my sisters did not have their plate. 
 I was on the verge of tears. A few minutes later the food is still not here and my dad realised that my sisters were sharing so we could actually eat and didn't have to wait for the last plate. My dad looked straight at me and told me I could eat and, of course, I was not happy and his telling me off wasn't helping.
 So he got upset again and I started crying, he told me to go to the bathroom and stop crying while calling me selfish for acting like this.
 In the bathroom my two sisters entered and I locked myself in a stall, then one of them proceeds to tell me that I was selfish and I shouldn't act like this because there are 6 of us in the family, I have an older brother, and I was ""bringing the mood down"", then they tell me to come out of the stall, which I dont.
 Then my mum comes in and tells my sisters to get out, which they did but without complaining about it first.  My mum tells me to get out of the stall, which I do, and she just hugs me asking me if I was just having a bad day, which I replied yes.
 We then went back to the table and my dad acted as though nothing happened and I was forced to put a fake smile on for the rest of the evening.
 I'm not sure how much I can take.

"Interesting morning, all before 9 EST","It all started innocent enough, just hello/good morning with a guy at work, until:

I had to hear on how the world is coming to an end in september. 

“You can’t tell the christians from the heathens, you walk in a bar and they’re all drinking, you gotta be ready for the rapture!” He said. 

I said you cant judge people and say when the world - he interupts, pulls out his bible, he rattles off some verses and says, we as christians have to indentify what people are doing, we dont judge, then i interupt and repeat what he says about people in the bar then politely ask him - what are you doing in the bar?

"Come, friend, let us travel this difficult road together","Greetings, traveler. Are you tired of walking this treacherous road alone? Me too...So why don't we offer each other some support? On a serious note I am a huge fan of single player games. Played over 1000hrs of Skyrim, deeply enjoyed Dragon Age Origins companions (love Alistair, Leliana and Sten) and quests, had a blast playing all three BioShock games, Alan Wake is a game that lives in my heart, etc. etc. But...Playing with friends is also so much fun, you know? Laughing together, winning or losing it is fun to play with friends. That's why I am looking for someone to play some games with, although it would be nice to be able to just chat/chill after our gaming sessions or before. BTW I am from Brazil, so please be from my time zone (GMT-3). Some stuff about me:

\-Some people said I'm smart, but I'm definitely not the ""book smart"" type. Never was much knowledgeable in stuff.

\-I work in a shitty job and only have one day off a week, yay!

\-Never was a weeb, but watched a few anime like Cowboy Bebop, Baccano!, AnoHana among others. And I'm also trying to read a manga called Yona of The Dawn.

\-Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Bladerunner are both movies I like.

\-I mostly play Grim Dawn now, but we can also try to play L4D2, Gunfire Reborn, Secrets of Grindea, Terraria, Starbound (with mods) and maybe Northgard. I am also very chill. Don't like to take games too seriously anymore.

We're the first known species on this planet to try to understand the universe. What if we're just here to set the groundwork for whatever species or dominant intelligence comes after us? Maybe humanity isn't the future but a stepping stone.,"The title kind of explains it all but how would you feel about that if it's true. That ""we"" never actually uncover all the secrets or that our species wont be here for any definitive answers, or advancements, that maybe we have an expiration date and all those stories of galaxy sprawling civilizations you see in Sci-fi books/movies isn't actually about us. That maybe we arn't the main characters of earths story, but maybe will someday become that ancient civilization, those ancient aliens who inspire a brand new species/consciousness. Maybe the idea of traveling to other solar systems/colonizing planets/meeting aliens wont happen for billions of more years. 

We're kind of stuck here in this timeframe of history and it's so crazy to me and kind of sad that we cant see beyond where we're at or that we're born in a time where we have a small glimpse into the universe but don't have any real answers as to the nature of what's really out there. No contact with alien life, no humans on other planets, short lifespans and so many questions we want answered but know wont come in our lives. 

I always want to think that when I die everything's just going to reveal itself, all the answers will come together and make sense, but that's probably not going to happen. I know i'm a little off subject now, but are you ok with the possibility of never really knowing anything for sure about the nature of existence? Like if gods exist out there in some forms, of what happened before the big bang, of what happened even on earth in the past, of what will happen in the future? Are you ok just seeing out the next few years/decades and then just ending you're experience with all of this?",0

Finding yourself is tricky,"I’m a 26M. Over the last 1.5-2years I’ve been going through a mental and emotional “growth spurt”. It’s been so long (in my mind) but I feel like with each day i feel more and more anxious about getting closer to who I am at my core, outside of the trauma response version of me. 

So for example I can talk at length about a childhood event that I now realise shaped my thinking and logic growing up and i can see how i need to change in order to move past it. However, it’s such a daunting task to essentially start afresh. View and respond to the world differently, with a new eye, but with the same people.

Is it worth buying a Nintendo Switch?,"So I've got a PS5 which I play a couple nights a week, have always played PS since I was around 8/9 and lockdown was days, rather than hours, playing Warzone, Battlefield (for 2 days), Minecraft, GTA V, Among Us etc. I've been toying with buying a Nintendo switch for a while but everyone I know that has them barely plays them after the novelty wears off.

If I was to learn a hobby which would be fun/worth my time?,"
**Electronic/Guitar music**-This was my favorite genre when I was younger discovering music,my inspiration is because of my favorite artist Teminite/Panda Eyes and just missing the old type of Dubstep.My reason for Guitar is when I first heard Shepherd of Fire by Avenged Sevenfold.But mastering these can take long and don’t listen to music as much anymore.

**Drawing/Animation**-I’ve always wanted to learn this because thought it’d be cool to make crossovers from different games/movies or my own animations when I was younger.My main inspiration is a Ytber I used to watch who made cool animations and an old coworker who likes to draw.But I don’t have a strong imagination liked I used to.

**Language learning**-I once was a curious person that tried to learn languages in the past as a hobby.It was fun to the point I could speak and remember a few words by learning through apps but stopped as soon as I became an adult getting a Full time job but maybe it’s possible to like learning again but don’t know if it’ll affect me since I’m a quiet person/slow learner but learned them from being inspired by music/tv/internet etc.

dear extroverted / social people: is it normal for some people to seem bored / unengaged when hanging out with you?,"context: i’m in college and have been trying to work on social skills because it’s been tougher to make friends than compared to high school in my personal opinion. i’ve been able to make friends and meet people who seem to like me so i know i’m not a complete social outcast (not many but some), and my therapist doesn’t think i have autism or asperger. however, sometimes i’ll hangout with someone 1 on 1 or happen to be walking home w them and they’ll seem unengaged / looking at their phone and seem to want to get our social interaction done with. they don’t seem to hate me but seem to dislike my company and i don’t know why. it’s been really affecting my self esteem because i often try my best to ask them questions and socialize as my best self. i think 60% of my social interactions are like this even though i’m not shy and i don’t know what to do so wanted to see if maybe other people experience this too.",0

My cat likes earwax. Animals are weird.,"My youngest cat, Ava, is obsessed with earwax. Ever since she was a tiny kitten. Back when we used to let our cats sleep in the bedroom with us, she would wake me up in the middle of the night licking inside my ear (and sometimes nose). She was so little her entire snoot could fit in there. It was so gross LOL But she was OBSESSED. Five years later, she still goes nuts for the smell or taste of earwax. If I have an itch in my ear that I use my finger to scratch, Ava will immediately run over to get a real good sniff before going crazy to lick my fingertip. She is so weird. But I love her.

Been thinking about getting a new tv,"I’ve had the same tv in my room for nearly 10 years. It’s at least 15 years old. It was my parents tv first and gave it to me when they got a new one for their room. It’s 24 inches, so not the biggest. I didn’t complain. It was a tv that worked in my room. I also didn’t have a job or driver’s license. It wasn’t like I could go out and get my own. 

I’m still happy to have a tv in my room. Obviously this one is outdated though. I figured since it’s Amazon deals day, it wouldn’t hurt to at least look for one I can afford. I do have a job now, but it’s only part time and I’m only making a little more then minimum wage right now. I can’t go crazy. I also want to pay for my own to make it harder for my mom to try and take it away. I was in a dark place for a little while and when mom found out, she thought it had to be because of the shows and music I like. I’m a metal head who loves anything fantasy related. (Which I’m still kinda confused about because mom is kind of a nerd herself and listened go Motley Crue when she was a teenager).

Someone you do lot of fun activities with even though you're *MILES* apart from one another, like you're in different continents, but despite the distance you do a lot of things together. Like watching movies or shows, watching YouTube videos with, share how your day goes, share your happy thoughts, even things that terrifies you. Someone who listens to you when you're happy or sad or angry. You text all day long and call all night and talk about everything there is and even though you share the entire day with them you don't get tired of their presence that you have meals with them over video call or just turn on your cam while you do your own thing, you reading and them playing their favorite video games while you both listen to the same song thru Spotify. And after the day goes and its time to sleep, you go to bed together and sleep with each other still on the phone because that's how you both love each others company.

Well I had that someone and now they're gone, I miss everything that we do and I miss them so much and no matter how I look for someone to somehow replace them, they can't even come close to them nor what we had.

"College is terrifyingly exciting, and I want to talk about it","Hi there, I (18f) am starting to realize that college is starting to really get onto me. 

Originally I was going in for a psychology major, mainly because mental health was a big part of my life for a long time. However recently, I started working at a podiatry office (foot doctor) as a medical assistant and receptionist, and let me tell you I have never felt so fulfilled going into work everyday. I look forward to helping the patients (90% elderly) to their rooms, chatting with them, and just overall enjoying seeing the doctor make their lives easier (which is usually trimming nails or removing ingrown toenails).

I'm now looking into nursing and become RN and going to specifically radiology nursing (I take x-rays and they take me aback. I'm artsy I guess and love taking pictures, so looking at all of the technology and the beauty of it all). Speaking of artsy, my dad is pretty adamant that I take at least one art course. I've been doing art all of my life, and its truly one of my passions, and he thinks I could do it as a side job. 

Overall, although college is scaring me, and I am completely overwhelmed, I'm so excited for anything the future holds. I just wanted to chat about this I guess since I'm pretty sure my parents are bored of hearing it all the time lol. Thanks Reddit for reading! I'd love to hear your stories too :)",0

I was glad I didn’t bothered him. But I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t knew what the right choice was. It maybe wasn’t a big choice but it mattered in that moment. 
Maybe that man would have lost his train or maybe I would have ruined his sleep.

Is there something about green color foods that people hate?,"So I've made posts on various subs of food I make, and I realized that for whatever reason, it's almost only ever green things I make that seem to get rude comments from people. Like a bowl of matcha oatmeal, matcha sandwhiches, ""ants on a log"" sandwhiches, bowls of vegetables, etc.

Point is, pretty much anything green colored. Generally I think the photos are well taken too, but I digress. I don't really understand why people seem to hate on green foods, maybe it's a childish sense of hating vegetables, but haven't most of us outgrown that? Or am I strange for liking broccoli, celery, spinach, etc?

This seems strange, that people (from what I can tell) are so often disgusted by the color green for a food. It's the color of most of nature. The shade of healthy trees and grass. Why not brown things instead? Why doesn't that bother people? Shouldn't a dark brown chocolate oatmeal or something look far more concerning than something green?

Anyways, does anybody else have thoughts on this? Do you find green colored foods to be gross, am I missing something here? Maybe I'm weird for liking green stuff in general, I just find it weird that it's only ever those things I make that get rude comments, regardless of the subreddit.",0

I am so mad at myself and just cried like a baby in my car.,"I had an appointment this morning at 8:30am, it was to finally be cleared for an injury to my hand caused by a car accident last year. I actually arrived there at 8:15 a full 15 minutes before the appointment, which rarely happens because I'm notorious for getting there last minute, and I felt so proud of myself. Mainly, because I only slept 4 hours because I've had negative intrusive thoughts that don't let me sleep at night.
Just as I was about to hop off my car and make my way to the office, I realized something terrible.. I didn't have my Insurance card or ID on me. It was in my other bag I use for work. Being in denial I called the office from the parking lot and asked if I could still be seen without the stuff (I know, I know), they said no and I have to reschedule for 2 weeks from now. They also said they implemented a new policy where they charge $50 for a reschedule, though they said I didnt have to pay it because theyre just nice people. But I plan to pay it to teach my dumbass a lesson.

Anyway, immediately after hanging up I just started near-on bawling in my car. I was so proud of myself for being on time and THINKING i was prepared but I wasnt. I havent felt good about myself for a long while, I finally had a moment of pride, and then it just got wiped out from something so stupid that could've happened to anyone and I just lost my mind. I still have tears welling up in my eyes lol
I can tell from the crying which i dont do much of that Im just not ok. 
Currently trying to hide from the fam so they dont see that I cried over something ""Minor"" and be dismissive about it... *sigh*",0

"Started getting a ""thicker skin"" and it's improving my life!","When I (26 NB) was growing, I was confident, opinionated and outspoken. During late teens/early 20s I went through some ""stuff"" and ended up hypersensitive and taking life extremely seriously.

But I started new meds a couple of weeks ago and I've started noticing a real difference! I commented on a post to an American explaining that I don't understand the concept of ""illegals"" as to me, if a person is born to this planet, how can they not be allowed to reside on the land of said planet?

Given internet culture, naturally this person resorted to a personal response. Saying ""looking at your profile, of course you don't."" To which I looked at my profile and my last post was a picture of myself. Bright yellow hair, piercings, tattoos, wearing a boho/gringo jacket, boho/gringo trousers, Doc martens, and a t-shirt with a picture of a flower saying ""come either rain or shine"".

I immediately burst out laughing to my phone. Because the commenter was spot on. Fucking A! Being raised by hippy parents makes you a kind of way and it really shows. This person's attempt at roasting, genuinely made me have a laugh at myself. And it felt GOOD. It genuinely tickled me and it's stuck with me.

Following this, a separate event transpired a couple of days ago. I saw a tweet regarding boomers not taking climate change and other ""new"" social issues seriously, so young people have edited minions memes to address these issues in hopes of attracting boomers to listen.

And of course, again as internet culture is, there were many unhappy boomers in the comments. One of which simply commented ""Not funny."" There were a plethora of comments calling this person various insults. But rather than add to the insults I commented; ""not funny at all! Hope Steve and the kids are.okay XXX are you coming to the BBQ on wededneseday.????...xxx LOL (lots of love)....xxxxxxx.""
A light hearted bit of fun, no real content whatsoever. In response I received, once again, a personal response, stating ""your kid is going to be really fucked up."" I imagine to the average person, this would be hurtful. However, I responded with ""jokes on you I'm infertile 👉😎👉"". I cannot have children and I am okay with that.

So being able to carelessly bounce off these insults without them hurting me, is honestly so refreshing and it feels GREAT!

I haven't been someone to comment on social media posts typically in a long time, due to the sensitivity I knew it was a bad idea. But feeling less sensitive I took a couple risks, and they turned out fine!!

I don't know if medication helps one heal in a linear way, but I hope this thick skin continues! Because not crying every time someone is mean to me, makes life SO much more enjoyable!",0

So how do you deal with your expensive hobbies?,"Since I'm not living in the US this hobby of mine of collecting figures is quite expensive when converting to my local currency.

COD:MW19 discussion for console.,"Posted this on a COD subreddit but it was removed for mentioning Cold War.. alright then..! MW19 is completely unplayable for me ever since Cold War.

I loved this game but I haven’t played it in nearly 2 years because, despite having the physical disc in the Xbox, I would constantly get “Purchase this game” on the Home Screen. Now it says “Campaign / Data pack missing”. I’ve deleted and re-installed, gone on to Manage Game and Add-ons and checked everything is installed properly. Cleared my Xbox cache and even gone as deleting Cold War and Vanguard from the system to see if that works.

What's a song you like from an artist you normally don't care for?,"I've heard about The Ocean for years. They're doing a lot of cool things in the progressive metal space, it just never grabbed me.

"Feel so overwhelmed by the question ""What are your hobbies?"" Anyone relate to this?","Is it just me or do you also get overwhelmed with the question ""What are your hobbies?""

The question appears to be innocent but if you think about it, the question, in and of itself, has an assumption. It is expected to be your answer falls into a certain category in music or sport etc. e.g. if you play a musical instrument you can say I play bass guitar. Or if you like a certain genre of books you can say I like reading self-improvement books.

My point is that in fact most people do plenty of things in their lives and it is hard to package those things into some well-established categories. For me, I like browsing Reddit and googling around on topics like tech, productivity, philosophy, and healthy lifestyle. Also, I like focusing on my hazy personal thoughts on external things and occasionally putting them into words to understand myself better.

The overarching theme is ""the Internet"" or ""Googling"". But can we say this as a hobby? Dunno, I just say ""I like reading and doing some gentle type of exercises daily."" But I am uncomfortable with my answer as it's not reflecting me actually.

Growing up doesn’t mean giving up,"I’m firmly in “mid-life”, perhaps beyond if mid-life is truly the midpoint of your life. From the time that I could first conceptualize “growing up”, it seemed like the goal was to outgrow your immature interests, hobbies and habits. It was this state of being whereby you didn’t need frivolous things to make you happy. 

Yet as I’ve hit this stage where I’m supposed to be “grown up” and “mature”, I am forever thankful that I’m still the free spirit goofball that I always was. I’m wiser and definitely have more knowledge, insight, and intuition - and a ton of responsibility- but I still love to play, explore and laugh at immature things. 

The people I know who seem the least happy are those who grew up, slowed down, and started preparing for retirement on the couch. They live vicariously through their kids, but don’t realize they could be living life right alongside them. Their conversations are filled with stories about things they “used to” do. 

I’m a big believer in a life of balance. Maybe it’s yin/yang,  but whatever it is, I feel the mind and body need balance….
1. If you are going to sit at a desk all day for work, the body wants to run, jump, lift, sweat etc later on. Or if exercise isn’t your thing, maybe balance a day of intense work with whatever you enjoy that symbolizes the opposite of that work energy (video games, grabbing a beer at the local bar, etc). 

2. If you are going to be “serious” and “appropriate” in one setting, perhaps the mind wants you to be loud and crack inappropriate jokes in another. 

3. For every minute spent working, find time to play. And if possible, make some elements of your work into play. 

4. If you are going to eat well, take your vitamins, and get a good night sleep all week, make sure you wash down a chocolate cake with a cold beer on the weekend….or whatever gluttonous reward you can imagine. 

I’ve seen way too many people give up on life too early. My one friend was a scholarship athlete in college, yet a 300 pound sad couch potato by age 30. On the other hand, my other friend is 48,  goes on regular adventures, balances work/fun, drinks beer, smokes weed, runs/bikes/climbs, looks amazing, and is in better shape than most teenagers.  

I’m hoping some GenZ folks out there read this. Growing up doesn’t mean giving up. It doesn’t mean putting away your toys or fundamentally changing who you are or how you spend your time. Sure, you will work more and your priorities will change a bit if you start a family, accumulate more things, and take on more responsibility…..but if you don’t find time to achieve balance, I don’t think you’ll like the person you’ll become. 

Enjoy!",0
The pineapple on pizza debate will never be settled because opposing sides are actually arguing about different things and both are right.,"People who argue for pineapple on pizza generally make the argument that it’s tasty af, and yea they are totally right. It is tasty. 

People who argue against it, though, don’t actually claim that it’s not tasty, they claim that it’s wrong. That it doesn’t belong on a pizza, that it’s not what the Italian ancestors envisioned or some other cultural version of that. 

The point is, I’ve never heard a pro-pineapple person say pineapple belongs in a pizza for cultural reasons, and I’ve never heard a pineapple denier say it actually doesn’t taste good (EDIT: the second half of this sentence is no longer true. Thanks jpon7). 

One side is fighting for culture, the other is fighting for tastiness. Thus, the debate lives on.

That is all. Thoughts?

Edit: thank you all for your opinions and thoughts. Indeed there is a spectrum to this and it’s not all black and white. Now, as I must be up for work in exactly 6 hours, I adjourn to rest and dream about the impossibly delicious thing that is a freshly made piping hot pizza pie. Thank you all, good night, and if you ended up ordering a a pizza because of this then sorry and you’re welcome

"My favorite time of year,","My favorite time of year is when the sky gets dark grey over a 2-3 day period and each day the temperature drops another 10 degrees,  the wind picks up until it’s going about 15-20mph, you know a storms comin, but it won’t be a bad one. No blown away sheds, or torn trailer park siding. Nobody is going to have a “wizard of oz” moment and wake up in a strange, new land. No, this is the kind of storm you welcome. This is a cleansing storm. 

This is the kind of storm, where, after it’s done, you start to think this world might be an ok place again if we just had a few more storms like that. This storm, this…this is THE Storm. The “pull out your original NES console grab a flashlight, take your wife and kids down into the storm cellar to put it all on the old tv you got when your last college roommate moved out, turn it on after, the power goes out, and realize you need electricity to run all that” kind of storm. The kind of storm that sends your toes into another world. When you rub those toes together, you make physical, human contact with another you, another version of yourself who is just rubbing those toes so perfectly! 
And the thing is…

You don’t even like having your toes rubbed, (or strange people touching you at all for, that matter), and here is the other version of you, the doppelgänger who knows you like he knows the back of his own hand (because it looks just like yours) and he’s Rubbing those toes right up there like he was Quentin Tarantino himself”

When you remember THAT kind of storm, you remember the good old days. The days when things were cheaper, but of a higher quality. The days when you sit on the porch at grandma and grandpas house on the steps of the house after a fall little league practice became your new favorite activity because the wind was blowing and it was a matter of time before the storm was coming and you just sat there and soaked in the cold like the little fat kid you were, raising those arms to get a breeze on your sweat soaked body, a time where you felt “cool” finally. And wished your overall body temperature was just 1 degree colder, so you might finally not be hot when you went to bed kind of evening waiting for that kind of storm, you make new memories on top of your old memories. You make memories of you sitting there remember infinity how nice it was to sit there back then from the first memory. 

Anyway, it was THAT kind of storm. So when that particular type of storm is coming and it’s of course a welcome one, we get up in the morning that day the rain starts, and we just sit there with the window open. The window is open, we get the cool breeze chilling our already top bed sheet covered bodies and we just listen. We listen to the storm rage. The crack of Thunder in your head like memories of The Nothing, from The Nevending Story, the bolt of lightning lighting up the darkened grey morning sky…",0

My view of video games as an adult has changed...,"Heads up: This probably won't be the post you're expecting. Also, I've been an adult much longer than I've been into video games. 

I do enjoy my time playing video games. I actually plan in some time to play during my week. After all, enjoying time doing nothing is still time well spent. There definitely is a mental health aspect to it. That said, I still have plenty of time for work, exercise, relationship, and creative parts of my life, so video games aren't my everything. 

The problem is that I've become acutely (painfully) aware that some games are simply designed solely to keep you sucked into their ecosystem.

For example, I LOVE the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises. Thoroughly enjoy them. But then came Fo76 and ESO. Along with them came the transition into daily grinding. Grinding for trinkets, grinding to keep up with your daily achievements, grinding for those perfect weapons & armor for your character.

Now, for contrast, FO4 and Skyrim, neither require the grind I speak of. There of course is a grind to get stuff in game, but you aren't coerced into signing in day after day just to keep up with the dailies or the chance to obtain items you wouldn't normally get. You can put the game down and come back a week later and pick right back up where you left off. 

Anyway, I literally just didn't bother signing in to Fo76 one day. Just walked away. Canceled my membership shortly after. A while later, did the same for ESO. I simply couldn't stomach it any longer. All the grinding just left me in a feeling of ""Why am I so wrapped up in this?"" I felt pushed into doing it day after day. So I just stopped.

I pulled out FarCry 5 and loaded it up, started a new game. Noticed right away, no grinding. I mean, yeah, there are challenges to unlock perks, and certain achievements in game unlock things like weapons or vehicles. But there isn't any pushing to get you logged in every day. You can literally put down the game and not have to worry if you'll miss tomorrow's dailies or item giveaway. There's no time frame. Just your own sweet pace.

I do look forward to whichever Elder Scrolls comes out next, same for Fallout 5. I just hope that they aren't tied into the daily grind model. Otherwise, I'll keep looking for more games like FarCry and Red Dead Redemption and play at my own speed with no worries.

Unless of course you guys can give me other ideas and suggestions. Lol!

I did karaoke in some British Sports Bar and I FUCKING LOVE IT! You should try it!,"I‘m not a person that is really confident about their voice or anything, so I didn‘t really plan on singing anything, when it was decided that we are going into this wonderful British Sports Bar.

As a German, I had a short culture shock considering that the entire ceiling of this place was plastered with signed tricots of rugby teams and the fact that all the elderly people in the bar were the most… outgoing… about the match that was running on the TVs - while the younger ones didn‘t even knew the rules. And maybe the fact that this whole thing happened in Spain was a factor, too, but I‘m not sure about this anymore after all that I‘ve seen here 😅.

Well, what can I say except that the whole thing was the most fun I had in weeks: Before karaoke began, we met a wonderful British guy who was down to talk with us (and who was a wonderfully humorous person throughout the entire evening - and not to mention a great dad to his daughter who wanted to sing, but was first afraid).

So, the whole thing started: The owner of the bar (it‘s run by a British family; he‘s a nice guy, too, btw) sang the first song and our group tried to hype the bar up a bit to his singing, which was a whole success; everybody was clapping and singing. After a few more acts it was the turn of a friend of mine and me, which I first didn‘t know as I didn‘t sign up for this. 

But well, there I was, singing country roads with her (and the rest of the bar), having a great time. I thought I sounded horrible - especially next to her as she is kind of a professional singer - but, as it turns out, I was pretty good, which she told me the next day after watching the recording of it the next fay being sober.

Not only we all were happy, but the bar owners, too. Us having fun has apparently attracted a lot of people filling the bar up and we got a few shots as a thank you.

It was great. I‘m usually not a person who is into this, but damn, this was great.

Tomorrow were going again, let‘s see how it goes ;)

You should maybe try it, too, fellow Redditor. It may seem impossible to do, but once you have your 5 Minutes of Fame it is great 😊",0
Are the things we do in life just a defocus of the reality?,"Are the things we are occupied with in life just a defocus from the harsh reality? 

School, learning, working, having hobbies, finding challenges and having goals, hanging out with people or traveling, running a business...

Now let's now zoom out of the planet. Now zoom out even more. What's there? Nothing. Its like our daily lives are completely detached from the harsh reality of the universe and existance in general.

It is like we as humans are doing all of these things just to occupy ourselves, to defocus ourselves from the harsh reality that we don't know why we exist and that away from our planet there is .. well, nothing. And since there is nothing we can do about it, we choose to defocus with daily life activities.

Altogether I've made like 4 fiends from Reddit, which isn't much, but still amazing nonetheless! There were some people who I talked to for a few days to a few weeks but we flaked out. Not anyone's fault really, life just got in the way or we're incompatible. Either way, no hard feelings. 



But yeah, anyway, I feel very fortunate to have met these 4 people (well, not met met like irl but you get what im saying).

The show only got one season, only 19 episodes. One of my favorite shows growing up.

For example, when I go out shopping and standing in line to check out, the woman in front of me just turned and started talking to me about random events in her life, the box of cream of wheat I bought, etc. Its one of my great ""smaller"" joys in life.",0
I don’t know how to spend our weekends to bond with my son,"Both my son (11) and I (30f) are home bodies and love our alone time. We spend many days separately doing our own thing to then come together at dinner. I get that feeling sometimes though that, as a good mother, I need to get him out doing things. The thing is I can never come up with anything. Anything I choose, the park, movies, museum, just ends in both of us kind of just playing the part and counting down the time until it’s appropriate to go home. Don’t get me wrong, I spend lots of time with him, I just feel more of that time needs to be outside the home. Anyone else here a homebody who found something they like doing outside the house?",0
What is something you missed out as a teenager?,"Like I grew up in a fairly conservative household,in India,so obviously I missed out on a lot of things that are considered normal in western households.

Is this how movies in the theater start now?,"So I went to see the new Thor movie (no spoilers). First off, didn’t they use to start showing the previews at the time the movie was suppose to start? We were 5 mins into the start time and ads were still showing before the previews even started. Movie was suppose to start at 3pm, didn’t start till after 3:30pm.

What annoyed me the most was that there wasn’t even any indication the movie was about to start. It used to be that I’d say something like “now our feature presentation” or at least something that showed the movie was about to begin. It was so bad that I thought the opening scene was just part of another ad or just a skit that would end with it telling people to be quiet. I was so confused. 

It was such a bad way to start a movie. 

Anyone else had this experience and is this how it is now?

Am i the only teen who DIDN'T rebel?,"I never had many responsibilities, my parents only made do 3 things: Chores that took 1 hour, going to school and maybe studying, that's it, so it's not like i ever had a reason to rebel i could do whatever i wanted.

What is a memorable conversation that you had with a stranger?,"I'm always curious about people's conversations or encounters that have had an impact on them or changed their outlook on things. 

I think one of my most memorable conversation with a stranger (well, technically two strangers), was when I was in a bar in New Orleans a few years ago listening to a live band. I sat next to an older couple who were chatting with a mother-daughter duo over the live music. 

The man had his left arm wrapped tightly around the woman, and she was leaning into him, a hand on his thigh, and her neck adorned with colourfully beaded Mardi Gras throws, even though Mardi Gras was weeks ago. 

The couple warmly invited me into their conversation, asking me about my impressions of the city and where I was visiting from. 

I then turned the conversation on them and asked how they met and how long they've known each other, because they seemed so in love. 

Their story goes back decades ago when they met on a beach in Florida. They had a summer fling but then lost touch, married other people, had kids, only to find each other and reconnect again years later. He's based in Australia, and she's from Germany. They now plan trips to see each other once or twice a year, and New Orleans happened to be the city they chose for their current rendezvous.

It was my first solo trip abroad, and my last night in New Orleans, so to end the trip listening to their story felt kind of magical. The reminded me of Jesse and Celine from Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. The way that the man looked at and talked about the woman was like she was his entire world. He seemed completely smitten by her. And she was smiling from ear to ear the entire time. 

When I got up to leave because I had an early flight the next morning, the woman touched my cheek, took off a pink throw necklace she was wearing and put it on me. 

I remember feeling like I was walking on air when I was returning back to my hotel. It was an honour to have listened to their personal story and to have witnessed and learned about such a romantic connection. But it also made me wonder about missed connections, second chances, and what it means to love someone enduringly. I was reminded that there are so many complex lives and different stories out there and throughout history, and I only got a brief glimpse into the story of two people. I don't think I ever felt sonder so intensely as I did that night. But, I also realize that because I only chatted with them for an hour or so, it was easy to romanticize their relationship and circumstance. Like I mentioned, they reminded of Jesse and Celine, and so I viewed them as being almost like fictional characters come to life. I have no idea who they are or what kind of struggles they've gone through or about the other people in their lives. But what I can be sure of is how the conversation made me feel and the introspection that followed from it.",0

And tropical vacations I don't get at ALL. I have no idea why I'd fly out to the Bahamas. What would I do when I got there? Go to the beach and do what? Just lay down on a seat under an umbrella for hours and drink alcohol a waiter brings me? I'd be bored out of my mind. It bothers me just thinking about it. I'd probably spend my whole vacation staring at my phone, and I can do that just as well from home.",0

I hate tourism but love being a tourist.,"Let me begin by saying I recognise that I come from a position of privilege and that this rant is 100% a First World Problem. I have been lucky enough to be able to travel overseas on a few occasions, and even though I wouldn’t say I have travelled widely, it’s more than many people do in their lifetime and I am grateful to have had the opportunity.

I like travelling overseas and I like doing all of the “touristy” things that come with overseas travel. I like to see the landmarks, visit the famous locations, and take all the typical tourist photos. But at the same time I hate what tourism has done to these places. As a tourist myself, I recognise the irony and hyprocrisy in this.

As an example, just before COVID hit we were lucky enough to go on a trip to Paris, where we naturally visited the Eiffel tower. While seeing the tower in person was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed sharing that with my family, on the other hand I couldn’t help but feel a little jaded by the experience as well. The area was covered in litter, the lawns were dry and worn out, there were loud tour groups making it hard to get around with a small child, and I felt on edge the entire time watching out for pickpockets and scammers. We were approached probably a dozen times by people wanting to give me a “friendship bracelet” or sell me cheap metal tower sculptures, or offering to take our photos. 

Theres a phenomenon known as Paris Syndrome, and from my experience, I totally understand where it comes from. However I've had similar experiences in London, Italy, Singapore and Dubai.

I hate long queues, large crowds, overpriced attractions and souvenirs, and persistent scam artists. I don't like the over commercialization of historical landmarks which I feel detracts from the overall experience. 

I feel it's a massive shame that while it's great that the world is/was (precovid) more accessible than ever, that same accessibility has turned these places into dirty, crowded, expensive tourist traps.

The advice I’ve read online about traveling  usually falls into two categories: Either be prepared to deal with these kind of stuff whilst abroad, or avoid these locations entirely and instead seek out the “hidden secrets” of whichever city you are in, which due to them being featured in hundreds of travel blogs, are no longer hidden nor secret.

Thing is, I WANT to see things like the Eiffel Tower. I feel like if I only get one chance in a lifetime to visit somewhere like Paris, I would regret it if I didn’t do the touristy things. On the other hand, the reason these places feel so disappointing is precisely because of people like me; foreigners who NEED that photo of themselves holding up the Leaning Tower, or whatever the local equivalent is. Again this is my privilege talking here; my selfish desire to see famous places is exactly what makes them suck.

The other aspect of this is that I’ve read a lot about how many of these tourist destinations, especially resort type places like Bali, Rio or Hawaii, while outwardly are made to look good to foreign middle class tourists, actually hide a lot of poverty that the locals suffer under just a few blocks away from the beaches. I don’t feel good ethically living it up in a resort while the locals living nearby are destitute.

I’m still feeling a little jaded from our trip to Paris, even though overall I had a great time because I got to share it with my family. With the world opening up post-COVID we’ve been thinking about travelling again and I've been trying to figure out how I feel about travelling now. 

Once again, I full acknowledge my own privilege and hyprocrisy here. I'm a tourist who hates tourism. I'm a privileged traveller complaining about effect my privilege has on the places I travel to. This whole thing is basically me recognising that conflict and trying to reconcile it.

I've never really talked to anybody about this except my wife, and I was just curious whether anybody else felt the same way? If so what's the best way to deal with it?",0
What's next?,"It hit me today that I'm no longer living close to my family and friends.

Workplace bullying,"I started a new job in the trades recently as a young woman and it’s insane the amount of high school drama there is. Everyone, I mean everyone talks bad about the other and I’ve only been there a week. I’ve witnessed more drama than when I was in school. It’s insane.

How to develop quick critical thinking skills and engage in conversations?,"I feel like my ability to critically think in a conversation is non existent. I want to be able to interestingly communicate and engage in a conversation rather than just be that person who just listens to what the other person has to say. It’s almost like I’m clouded by the fact that I involuntarily don’t care about the conversation at hand and instead of rationally thinking, have just developed automated thoughts about what the person is thinking about me. 

This is something I want to change, to make myself more interesting and actually feel some form of connections with people. It’s so much easier to take the time to write this message out, than to actually instantly come up with the thoughts. I’m not really sure where this post is going but I just want to get this off my chest and start engaging in more critical or interesting conversations for my own good. Developing good habits.",0
Anyone else wonder what the average person whistling aimlessly would sound like in past?,"I whistle all the time. I catch myself whistling tunes to songs I have in my head, random mixes of different songs, or just whatever tune I feel like.

Is it true that your life is a reflection of your intelligence and potential?,"A conversation I was having with someone a few days ago has still been lingering in my head. It basically boiled down to him saying that everyone's life is a reflection of their capabilities. It went a lot deeper in to conversations about intelligence and gifts and stuff but basically he was saying if my life sucks it's because I suck. It makes me think back to when I was younger and how people swore up and down how smart I was and what I'd accomplish one day

 Now I look at myself, 31, no job, sleeping on someone's couch, basically homeless. I could sit here and go through all of the reasons as to how I got here but to the world I realize it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that I failed to be a man. They saw the world rewards those who are deserving of it. I just wish the amount of effort I put in with all the tools I had matter as much.

"""You're less qualified if you don't travel"". - I've heard that.","Have you ever felt social pressure to travel? What do you think of travel culture?

I worked at a school for the elite where teachers were implicitly divided into two categories: those who traveled and lived abroad and those who didn't. I was part of those who didn't. 😂

There was a lot of pressure for us to travel. The school organized educational tours in Europe, USA, Canada... and they wanted us to buy the package. Their justification: we had to be at the same cultural level as the students (who are rich and travel the world). And the group of the well-traveled teachers looked down on us, sometimes even saying it clearly that people who don't travel are ignorant.

There was so much pressure that I eventually had to travel to put it in my curriculum. And yes: I've met a number of people who actually write a section of their ""cultural trips"" on their CV. I guess some employers must value that.

&#x200B;

Brazilian writer, Ariano Suassuna, tells a story: he was invited to dinner at a rich family. The mother told the writer:

""I'm very upset with my children's school because the teachers don't have enough high cultural level to talk to my three sons.""

Ariano Suassuna thought: ""Teachers don't have enough level to talk to her kids?! She must be the mother of Noam Chomsky, Umberto Eco and Richard Dawkins!""

The mother continued: ""They go to Disney every year. How can a teacher who has never left Brazil teach my kids?""

Ariano Suassuna never left Brazil, and was one of the greatest Brazilian writers.

Don’t know what to do today,"It’s Saturday. I’m often either stressing or preparing or anticipating something in my life, but after my recent promotion at my job I’ve sort of been on cruise control for a while now.

I finished my coffee with some Shipley donuts. I tried watching stuff on Netflix/HBOMax but I can’t bring myself to watch anything. I’m actually vaguely annoyed by all the TV shows.

Nothing popping up on my YouTube feed either. The thing is, I don’t want to do “nothing” today, I want it to be a productive Saturday. As I get older I value my time more and more, I don’t want this Saturday to slip through my fingers.

But I also don’t want to work. There’s always more work to be done, it won’t change what I’ll have to do come Monday. 

I could go to the laundromat and clean my clothes. I could go jog. I’ve been meaning to go to an ATM and get some more bills for my wallet.

But I feel in general I don’t know what I should be doing in life in general. I worked for a long time to get this promotion, and now I go it.

I want to get a girlfriend, but I know I need to develop my hobbies and interests more. I’ve been trying to lose weight, but that’ll be a long process. 

I’m the happiest that I’ve been in almost my entire life. There were only key times that I was happier, but right now I’ve got a subtle sense of contentment.

But I also feel numb. I feel like I’m getting dumber, getting lazier. I feel a bit purposeless.",0
what're you guys all looking forward to in your life :),"i was chatting to some of my friends about post school plans, and it kinda brought up this question.

a lotta kids my age (myself included) don't have any immediate goals, their hobbies are time killers more than legitimate investments that they care about, their relationships are half built on convenience, so stuff to look forward to feels similarly unimpressive? 

so, i just wanted to hear what everyone else is looking forward to in their life so i can root for you guys a bit and maybe get a clearer idea of what sorta stuff to look out for 💕",0

"What exactly is a ""morning person"" to you and who do you know that actually is one?","I don't really know what a morning person technically is. For example I like getting chores done really early to get them out of the way so I try to wake up as early as possible like 5 am or sometimes earlier. I don't enjoy doing that though and normally I naturally will want to wake up at like 7 or 8. Does anyone even know someone who's a morning person? What makes them a morning person?

"oh wow, such an interesting title","It all begins in year 6 (to those American's that's 5th grade) and me and my friends were playing tag. There were 5 of us, but that's not very important. The part of the school we were playing in had this row of outside seats on an inverted corner going up 3 rows, and facing the outside a little bit lower there was one more seat, that one seat is important to the story.

Now that the context is out of the way, I'm going to actually say what happened. Me and another of my friends were at the top seat on the row. Ben was chasing another friend but couldn't quite catch him. So he started coming towards us. We panicked and I turned to jump to the ground, when I tripped. Remember that seat facing the outside and that we were on the corner? I spun around to look at Ben and he seemed quite surprised. I fell on the corner of that seat, the exact **tip** of the corner made contact with the middle of my back.

Usually my back would've been snapped in half, but I wouldn't be writing this if that was the case. Instead I bounced off, yes, bounced off. I started spinning backwards, literally doing an unintentional backflip and landing safely on the ground feeling nothing at all. No pain, no recoil, nothing. My friends just stared for a moment before going ""Welp! That happened!"" and moving on. While I was left there questioning my very existence. To this day I still have no idea how I managed to not get hurt at all. I mean, surely I'm not insane in thinking that. Just thought this would be an interesting first post like this so, hope you enjoyed.",0

I think my mom has an addiction and its driving me insane.,"So i am the youngest of 3 siblings, my older two brothers moved out already. I believe what my mom has is an addiction. I cant tell her nothing because then she gets offended and then my dad gets pissed off. My dad however agrees with me. My mom likes to go thrifting and she doesnt stop bringing home a bunch of stuff. We are middle class and I know she loves to be frugal. I dont see anything wrong with that. However she doesnt stop buying endless stuff from the thrift store. I suppose one mans trash is another womans treasure but its gotten to the point where its ridiculous. 

The whole garden is full of ornamental iron work and pots. She has hundreds of plants. I suppose theres nothing wrong with that either. However its gotten to the point where she just brings the stuff home and then piles it somewhere because she doesnt know what to do with it. All the hundreds of plants, ornaments, globes, planters, hanging stuff. It looks like a crazy cat lady type of deal. My only concern with that is that everything gathers dust  and breeds a bunch of spiders and cobwebs. 

The kitchen is another story. We have like 8 can openers. 10 different jars of salt. I bought her a pretty good quality pan set for christmas. She still goes and buys 20 more from the thrift store. We have like 6 1qt sized pans. Each one has a specific use. One for boiling water, one for coffee, one for soups etc. All sorts of mix and match utensils about 50 different tupperware containers. I bought her a Ninja Blender and then she goes out and gets another from 1984 just for her salsas. For some reason we have like 30 water bottles and only she uses them. We have a whole bunch of mugs and only my parents drink coffee at home. Half of this stuff doesnt ever get touched. I mean sure its a great idea to have more than you need for guests but even that should have an ideal limit. Theres like 40 bottles of different hot sauces that hardly ever get touched. But shes always complaining that the house is too small (1200sq ft) and where else shes supposed to put stuff. 

Then theres this other thing where she cooks for a family of 4 or 5. Then she complains that nobody eats and the food goes to waste. Theres 3 of us in this household. My dad eats at work and small portions. I graze on whatever she makes or i make myself. But if i say not to make giant caseroles then doesnt want to cook anything.   

Her closet is another story but thats between her and my dad because its not common space. 

I am not OCD but I like when stuff tends to be organized or matching. I love her and understand that she is being frugal by thrifting but seeing all this stuff in the way of everything is just triggering.",0
Question for people that grew up in a big city. Do you ever wish you grew up in a small town or away closer to nature?,"Wasn’t sure how to word the question, but I grew up in a small city but our family always took vacations that were camping, fishing, bonfires, outside activities. It was wonderful, but I always wanted to visit the big cities you hear about in movies or just in general have a different experience. (LA, New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, etc.) 

In the past 2 years I have been able to travel more places for work and have moved to a big city and I always feel myself missing nature. Like constantly. It’s fun, but not what I thought it was (not bashing these places at all!)

But it had me curious… people that never grew up around camping and cabins and nature, do they sometimes get sick of the city at all and want to try camping ? Obviously, everyone is different. But is it a common thing?  Or more of like- you want what you grew up with? 

Just curious of other peoples thoughts. That’s all. 

I hope anyone who reads this is having a good night tonight (:",0

A couple of teens came in our store and everyone thought they were stealing,"I was working my shift at the dressing rooms when a few teenage boys came by with kids backpacks, sunglasses, hats and shoes, all from the store. I counted the items they had. I then counted their clothes, handed them their numbers, they went in, changed and came out. Asked me to take a picture of them in their new fits. I laughed and gladly snapped a few. Then they came out, handed me their clothes, said their thank you's and went on their way. 

I didn't think anything of it. They were kind and fun. 

I entered the dressing room and was a bit mortified at the mess I had to clean up though: all those sunglasses, hats, shoes, and bags, the same number I counted. Nothing was missing. I turned on my walkie and told the other associates about the mess. When the boys walked in the store, my manager said to keep an eye on them, so I thought I should give an update. 

My manager asked why those things were in the dressing rooms. I said they walked in with them. He told me that wasn't allowed. Me, a new employee still in my training period, said I was confused. Customers are not allowed to take bags in their dressing rooms. I said I'll watch out for that next time. 

My manager told the store, ""they're definitely up to something."" He came by and lectured me a bit, took the bags, and watched them. 
I saw them by the shoes section gently pushing each other and laughing. They just seemed like playful teens, as annoying and immature as teenagers are. 

But . . . several other coworkers came by and asked what they were up to. I said they just tried on clothes. It seemed that no matter how much I emphasized how I really did count the items they took it and left with, everyone still assumed they were stealing. 

My manager said to take their descriptions and profiles when they exited and that they ""definitely didn't pay for something."" I was very confused. 

Something didn't sit right with me. I talked with a coworker and they said that everyone suspects groups of teenagers when they pop into a store. But to this extent? Everyone was watching the five of them, my manager was freaking out. 

I wondered if it was because they were black. 

I'm so tired. I'm so tired of everyone telling me what I should have done, lecturing me, and of everyone gossiping about what they could have been doing. I love my job because I love the customers, I could work all day, but this? I couldn't wait to go home. I've been told that I always have a positive and glowing energy even late in the day. Not today.

Have You Ever Lost a Memory of Meeting Someone?,"

I got a friend request from a stranger I did not recognize, but my friend claims that I’ve met the guy and even had a long conversation with him, which I do not recall at all. Has this ever happened to you? 

This happened years ago, and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable and paranoid. One day, I got a friend request on Facebook from a stranger. I then noticed that he was friends with one of my friends, so I asked my friend if he knew the guy. 

He said that we both met the guy at the same time when he showed up at one of our gatherings a few months earlier. I had no memory of talking to the guy or even going to the gathering, so I asked my friend what he was talking about. Then, he  told me that the guy and I were having a conversation for a long time. 

I had known my friend deeply for years, and he was definitely not the type to mess with me like that. Totally confused, I asked him if he had mistaken someone else for me. He started to get irritated, asking me if I was joking and saying how could he possibly mistake someone else for me. 

No matter how hard I tried to remember, I couldn’t recall meeting the guy or even going to the gathering. The reason I was so confident that I didn’t go to that particular meeting, was because my friends and I would hang out at the same place regularly a few times a week, but they just started hanging out at a different place, and I stopped showing up then, because I was getting busier and busier around that time. 

So, I clearly remembered that I’d shown up at their gatherings at the new place only once, but my friend claimed that I’d shown up one more time, hung out with them, and talked with the guy for a long time. 

I accepted the request from the guy and went through his pictures with the hope of evoking a memory, but I still couldn’t. To this day, I wonder if I was in a state of amnesia or something. It scares me because I sometimes wonder if there are more memories that have been lost. Has something like this ever happened to you?",0

What would you like to do/see if you could fly?,"I'm always insanely late to any party, and fighting games aren't really my style. They are my fiance's however and he plays a lot of Smash and was telling me how big a deal it was when Sora was released. We've been playing the Kingdom Hearts trilogy together for awhile now and when we reached a save point today he randomly showed me the reveal trailer when Sora was released for Smash.

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH!!! I got so many chills, one because it was SO beautiful with the music and the flying and his perfectly charming expression. And also because just the previous night I had a wonderful dream where I could fly. Completely untethered, with no difficulty at all, just like him. I didn't care if I could go see any big travel destination or anything.

If you could have a power like that in real life, what would you most like to do with it? (Aside from being a superhero) I would just like to admire the beauty of the sky during sunrise and sunset and be amongst the trees. Really just enjoy nature, but with insanely awesome views and a greater feeling of freedom. I want to feel like Tinker Bell.

**TL;DR - Had a dream where I could fly exactly like Sora did in his Smash release trailer. I would LOVE to fly like that for real, just for the pure pleasure of it. If you could fly, what would you most like to do to enjoy that power, besides be a superhero?**",0
I used a bunch of knowledge from my random interests to solve my sis job emergency,"I want my patts in the back and a macgyver award. 
This story might be a lil too long for not much, but it is honest work.

My sis and I have extremely similar interests. The solution would have come to either of us. Her main issue is that she has been working for 21 hrs straight.

We work in fashion and my sis is dressing a talent for a televised award show. She had to pick up the outfit chosen by the talent in a store. The outfit: a swimsuit latex top and a skirt.

The thing with latex it that it isnt normal fabric, you just have to look at balloon to see how fragile it can get. The store that had the outfit gave her the swimsuit in a wire hanger, and poke multiple holes in the shoulders. No regular patches, heat or sewing will fix that.

She comes home at 1am and needs to leave at 8am. 

Most craft shops with latex glue and latex patches open at 11am.

Now, we are extremely geeky with love for cartoons and anime. We also love drawing and arts and crafts. Naturally cosplay picked our interest. We aren't super outgoing so we decided that a good middlepoint was fashion, but Cosplay was always the main target.

Another interest we have is H2O just add water and their SFX prosthetic tails. We got super obsessed with how the mermaid tails were made, so we both fell into an SFX makeup and prostetics hell hole with a bunch of stan wilson studio video tutorials and more.

Many people confused our interest in animation and SFX with painted art and plastic arts, so we kept receiving art supply kits with a bunch of essentials.

With cosplay in our interest sphere, there are tons of tutorials available with DIYs using odd materials, something that in our fashion curriculum would never teach. So we also got into deep dives of prop, sewing, and leather craftsmanship tutorials. One of the youtubers we see decided to experiment with latex just last week.

Our everyday work forces us to be informed and competent in hair and makeup so that is also a bonus.

All of this takes us to today and the incompetence of an intern in a careless clothing store.

My sis is stuck with an irreparable swimsuit, complete exhaustion and less than 7 hours of sleep. Im coming to the rescue.

My sis brain is fried and the only solution she can come up with is latex cement just to seal the holes, but with no way to access a store to buy it.

From the tutorial we saw last week we know the girl cleaned the latex with something, added glue, and stick it to another piece of latex. From our SFX knowledge we know latex is very finicky with other ingredients and materials.  We have liquid latex for halloween costumes, but is stuck in a halloween storage box, but that lead me to think if there was somewhere open for special effect makeup, or halloween stuff or something. But nowhere was going to be opened on time, BUT there is a shop with drugstore, gifts and makeup that is opened from 6am to 1am. 

Hope! 

I know makeup artists have to constantly ask if the clients have any allergies, one product comes often: Eyelash Glue! because of its latex content! That store also has gifts and farmacy so I figured my sis can find either latex gloves or latex balloons and use them as quick patches. Two out of three problems solved.

Finally I needed to figure out the cleaner used for the latex before the glue. Mineral Spirits. whatever the fuck that is suppose to be. Google tells me it is a solvent for interior painting... and fine arts!!!
I reach into my forgotten paint gifts drawer and find an oil solvent and an odourless solvent. The odourless solvent has another name according to google; Mineral Spirit!. Strike Three!

It might not be much, it is a simple patch after all, but that patch needed so much external expertise in hopeless hours.

What is an appropriate amount to wear something before you wash it?,"I work as a personal home assistant for an early 40s single dad, and his laundry habits have been bothering me so much. I don't know how he manages to go through so many clothes in a single day. I'll work Monday, do all the laundry, take off Tuesday, and when I come in Wednesday there's just a huge pile of clothes him and his 3 girls have worn in a day. 

He has me do probably 2-3 small ass loads of laundry a day; not only do I imagine his power and water bill are ridiculous, but he is considerably reducing the life of his washer and dryer. I'm happy to do it, but I'm just so perplexed by it. 

I MAYBE get changing your underwear twice a day, but he'll wear just lounge pants to sleep in once and consider them dirty. 

I have always worn things a few times before I wash them, unless I'm outside in the heat or doing something that may obviously make my clothes dirty. Lounge clothes especially dont make sense to me, you arent doing anything in them to make them dirty. 

Laundry is annoying to do, I want to ensure I get as much out of a wash as I can.

How much stock do you put into review scores/ratings before buying a product or using a service?,"I feeling people put too much stock into review scores than actually reading the review. I get why review scores exist. It is a short handed way to indicate if something is good and/or worth your time. However, I believe numbers don’t tell the whole story. Every review is based mostly on feelings so there is no consistency in grading.

I see this with video games all the time. People are so attached to that Metacritic score to justify if the game is good and anything below an 80 is terrible. Then you read the review and the flaws the review points out don’t bother you at all. I play sub 60 games all the time and I enjoy myself. Cons are different from person to person. I saw it recently on Amazon. I need to buy a phone charging adapter. I found one with a bunch of three star reviews talking about a light on the adapter that is too bright for them to sleep with which was the only con they had. I agree that is a con some people but that con didn’t effect me since I was going under my desk at work. Taking the numbers at face value instead of reading, people will think the charger is crap. 

Personally, I am very skeptical on review scores. I know more people will most likely review something if they personally had a negative experience. I do question if there are more people who had positive experience but just don’t go out of their way to review it. This is something I just ponder. I also do question overly positive reviews. I know a lot of those can be bought, imposed by the vendor or like something too much not to give it a low score. It is weird. 

TLDR: Too many people take review scores too seriously. People should read a few reviews rather than just look at the number.

"It has been extremely rainy here this summer, and honestly, I couldn't be happier about that.","Where I live, it's usually super dry here, and makes it miserable. However, it's been very rainy this year, and it's made me happy. Not only has it been rainy, it's also been cloudy and somewhat foggy too. It's been very nice to have a break from the endless, brutal sunshine, the awful dry weather, and it's especially nice seeing green grass. I've gone out every day it's rained, and enjoyed it so much.",0
Shout-out to all the parents that did their best,"I just wanted to thank all the parents out there that are doing their best and have raised people to the best of their ability. 

Not everyone has the ability to go on vacations and i know a lot of people struggle with providing for their families. I hope your children see your struggles and are kind to you. If they are not now, i hope they are in the future. I hope that they see your struggles and work harder to give themselves the best future and outcome for following generations. 

Thanks for doing the best you can and i wish the best for all the families out there.",0
"So I needed antifreeze, I live near walmart and advance auto.","Whenever I go to walmart, i get more than I need, so I went to advance auto. Got the antifreeze, $21, stood at the counter the only cus in the store. One guy behind the counter stocking. Another guy behind the counter on the computer. Third guy stocking shelves. Waited about 3 mins, ngl, was silently pissed, no one came to the counter. 

I took it back to the shelf, and blurted, it’s ok, I’ll head to walmart., didn’t yelI but i was snarky. I heard, “ok”. I walked out. 

Now i got to go all the way to the back of walmart, where the auto dept is, I found the same antifreeze, $13.xx. 

Glad I went. Now I’m looking at other things I buy from AA and walmart have Seafoam (motor treatment) for $2 cheaper than advance auto. I just bought seafoam earlier in the week at AA. 

I feel so much better, not pissed anymore bcuz if they came and checked me out at AA, I wouldn’t have gone to walmart for auto needs but now I know to go there, it’s cheaper but we are getting O’Reilly’s parts store soon, so maybe the cust service and prices will be better than walmart and aa.",0
what's everyone up to this weekend??,"i have friend birthdays to celebrate both nights, and during the days i plan to kick some butt on the weeds that have been growing up in my flower beds! if i get a chance, there will be a nap, because naps are one of the best things we have in this life.",0
How do you relax after a hard day?,"For me, my ideal is drawing a freezing bath and sitting in it. I drink a cold beer and finish with a hot shower while the water drains.

Home alone!,"My boyfriend is away, but I'm just wasting my time. What do you think I should do? This doesn't happen often, so I'm not used to it and kind of stuck in a pattern. Would really like some suggestions! What do you do when you are home alone?",0
You are not a machine,"As someone who struggled for years with depression I've finally realized something: you don't need to force yourself to work, to function. You are not a machine. Taking a break, relaxing is not spoiling yourself - it's a basic human need. There is no reason to force yourself to suppress it or act 'strong' - you need it. And even more important, you deserve it. Let me repeat it: You deserve to be treated like a human being. So please, get yourself something sweet when you crave it, treat yourself something expensive now and then or go somewhere nice. You are worth it. 

You are a beautiful human being, you deserve to be loved, to be treated nicely - especially by yourself.",0
Why do people you’ve cut out of your life try to reach out again?,"Never understood why someone would feel like reaching out to someone who obviously is cutting them out of their life is a good idea. It only leads to awkward and forced conversations , an explanation to why you cut them off that feels lacking in truth, and sometimes an excuse for the person who feels wronged to play the victim and make you feel guilty for doing what you feel is best for you.

I,personally, feel like sometimes the best way to end any relationship you feel is not for you anymore because you were either wronged , or you feel like you’ve grown apart, is by gradually reaching out less and less to them, until it fades out by itself. 

So why do people still reach out, and demand that you explain why you suddenly disappeared after a long period of no contact?",0
Did you guys watched the new Thor?,"I didn't like it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I think I'm just done with marvel in general I suppose. I don't seem to enjoy those movies anymore",0
Got into my first car accident last night…I’m okay but really upset about my car.,"Was driving home from work and took a route I didn’t know because maps said it was faster. Lane was ending and I couldn’t find a gap to get over, it was after work rush and a semi was also in the lane. The driver in front of me struggled too and hit the gravel and fishtailed but made it back on the road. I wasn’t as lucky, slowed down but hit the gravel and ended up in a ditch. 

It’s my fault, I panicked once I realized car in front of me hit gravel. I’m usually VERY good about avoiding being in a lane that ends but it was a mistake and I was on unfamiliar roads. I was completely panicked and in shock and was lucky a very kind man saw it happen near his house and came out to check on me and call 911. 

I’m okay, just a bit sore here and there. My car was leaking a bunch of oil and other fluids and my front passenger wheel is damaged, not sure if suspension/frame is messed up. I’m just waiting to get it checked out by insurance. I just feel like a complete idiot and am very shaken up about it. 

I know a car is replaceable and my life is not, I just feel horrible about it. This is my first car I got when I graduated HS as a gift from my parents, I’ve been super careful as a driver (I’m 22 now) but I’m just upset about the damage to a car I loved and appreciated. 

Any advice or stories of your first accidents?",0
Time Capsule in a Kitchen Junk Drawer,"My In-Laws bought this house in the 80s, so some of this stuff is from when the house was first built!  Items date from 1966 - 1992 (That's when they got divorced... proof that men don't clean and my MIL is a hoarder!)

"Claustrophobic people, what made you realize you were claustrophobic?","Was there a particular situation or event that made you realize your fear? I don't have a specific thing that happened, I just slowly came to the realization I wasn't comfortable in tight spaces anymore. As a kid I enjoyed tight spaces, I think because I knew I could always wiggle out. I'm not obese, but as you get bigger you do tend to realize you can't wiggle out of things as much. I think that combined with a greater realization that death is coming added to fatigue, makes the idea of getting stuck in a compact space very frightening.

But is the fear of being stuck in an air vent considered claustrophobia when most everyone would be afraid of that? Or is claustrophobia more like being scared of a relatively small space like an elevator or something where it doesn't make total sense to be afraid?",0
Just got up to get some coffee. I’m really happy about it.,"This past week, I’ve been feeling awful. Yesterday was an all time low for me. I got home from work; I didn’t eat, I only drank water, I was in tears. I wasn’t in a good place yesterday. 

This morning, I felt just as bad. Well, I talked with an online friend, I even asked a few questions to work about one of the things that’s been bothering me. I felt a little better after doing this. 

I actually felt good enough to get up and make some coffee for myself. I even feel okay to go get something to eat.

That’s all. I really wanted to share that.",0
Am I a bad grandpa?,"Our two youngest grandkids, 17 & 14 still like to come spend the night with Nana and Tata. They both love a breakfast cereal, ""Reyna"" loves her ""Frosted Flakes"" and ""Boot"" loves his ""Coco Puffs"". So what I've begun doing is going to Winco Foods and buying the generic versions of their cereals, in bulk, and refill their name brand boxes!?!

I am 19 and my doctor called me a little kid,"I went to get my eyes checked by a new doctor (female in her late twenties/early thirties).
Nothing out of ordinary here but this is where the problem begins. 

For some reason while checking my eyesight she left me alone and went somewhere. As she was getting back I heard her talking to her coworkers that she currently has a patient, a little kid 16-17 years of age.

I don't know why in the world but this really offended me quite badly. Please don't get me wrong I am young and inexperienced, I do consider myself a kid because I am indeed a kid.

The problem here is that I am being called a ""little"" kid by someone who is easily young enough to be my parent's child. My parents are in their mid 50's and they do call me a ""little"" kid but this doesn't offend me. The are my parents who raised me from a little baby they can call me a little kid forever. 

On the other hand doctors are in a formal and serious environment, they are supposed to be professional with their behaviour and treat all of their patients equally no matter how old/young they are.

Now because I am young, I am treated with complete disrespect and I am not taken seriously, how shameful.. 

As a people's pleaser now I am starting to hate people more and more.

Another thing to mention is that my dad was with me during the appointment because the hospital was far away and I don't have a driver's license. He also helped when I forgot to mention some things to my doctor.",0
It's healthy to get offended,"You are at a party after working hard from Monday to Saturday and now you are trying to enjoy your weekend with your friends. You are happy!

But as soon as the party starts, just for the sake of “sarcasm”, your friends start cracking lame and tasteless jokes in front of others just to be the “cool” dude. You know, seeking attention is really important in a party, either you do it with your achievements or you become the “funny” guy who doesn’t care about others feelings. 

He keeps going on and on about some random things that happened in your past or about your job or about your physical appearance and you keep listening and laughing with others, just because you don’t want them to know that it’s affecting you. Even though all you can think about is punching his face.
What would have happened if you’d shown a little offence? 

You would have drawn a line, a limit in which your “funny” friend and others have to be. And then? You wouldn’t have to drown yourself in the pool of guilt of not showing a little courage and YOUR mental health would have been better.
Sometimes you need to stop being the “good” guy and be who YOU are.

Does anyone know any good handheld consoles that you would recommend?,"Hi everyone, I got a YouTube shorts video recently of an Anberic console where the user was playing old PS1 games from it.

Have you ever noticed that villains tend to have pretty good vocabulary?,"I was watching the second and third seasons of Yu-Gi-oh! For old times sake, right? 

Line from Yami Marik: “and to think that pour soul was once your loyal servant. It is nice to see he's getting repaid by his exalted king.”

Then, two more lines from resident evil village come to mind.

Lady D: “oh, so gauche. What do we care for bread and circuses?”

Mother Miranda: “the villagers, those four new children…they could do nothing to assuage my years of loneliness!”

It definitely makes sense as to why writers do it; to add to the sort of aloofness to the characters/a mastermind aura, but I also think to make them feel more distant from the audience by using words not normally used in everyday conversation. Plus it helps me get some good words in context for the GRE 😉

Can you guys think of any other villainous vocab?",0
First year of Uni is finally over!!,"I passed my first year (Digital Design Ba(Hons)), with 61% and 120 credits.  I’m honestly surprised, not because it was hard though, (the first year is usually super easy plus for the first time in my life I’m actually studying something I’m naturally talented at). I’m surprised because I barely went to any lessons due to me being lazy and because of my agoraphobia. I don’t even wanna know what my attendance percentage is, but my teachers were slightly worried since I wouldn’t turn up, but instead they would get so much random work from me.  I’m honestly scared for the second year, because I don’t think I’ll be able to avoid classes/lectures, and I’ll actually have to do some …”Harvard referencing”🤢.",0
"Worst Day Ever, Just tired","I am a part time freelancer with some online company. I handle varieties of clients, and each client must give his/her view based on how you handle them during the entire process.

 Now, I recently got one client, out of nowhere, he specifically singled me out, and told the the support team that, I want all my jobs to be handled by {...}.
It's now a month since I started working with the client. Today, out of nowhere, the client cancelled close to six jobs I had handled. No proper reason and left a very bad review.

I tried to plead with the client, he didn't bother to listen/read my messages. I have been summoned by the support team. I am at verge of losing it all. No one wants to listen to me. Perfectly hard time for sure. I am really broken, sad and weak, somehow I depended on this to meet some of my needs. 

What is the best approach for this ?",0
Got myself a Wii... Its games are a good way to let off some steam.,"I'm short-tempered. Normally, I would either break something inexpensive, kick something, or punch a wall. I know, it's unhealthy, but I try to work on it.

10 years ago, mom bought a Wii on Black Friday, so we could play Wii Sports. We sold the console a few months later, because we didn't really play it. Ten years later (last month), I've been nostalgic about it, and wanted to revisit it. Someone I know was selling theirs for cheap, so I bought it. Been playing Wii Sports on it whenever I get the chance.

Fast forward to today. I wasn't having a good day (rather not talk about it), and I was started to feel violent, like I wanted to punch someone. Then I remembered that there's a boxing game on Wii Sports. So I turned the thing on, and started throwing some punch...

And **IT FELT GREAT!** My anger was slowly waning away, and my heart started to beat rapidly. It felt like Adrenaline has started kicking in. Best of all, I haven't broke anything! It looks like, I found a more healthier way to let that steam off.

If you have anger issues, and you still have that Wii stored somewhere. Dust it off, and give it a try! Speaking of which, does anyone still have theirs?",0
I think I'm finally happy.,"No, strike that, I KNOW I'm finally happy. Its been literal ages since I felt this way. I'm over my ex, I've forgiven her for the shit she did, I realize its not my fault, I deserve so much better. I hang out with my friends more, I'm getting back into music, I'm playing guitar and singing a lot- after like, 3 years now-, I'm hitting the gym constantly, I'm getting back into skating, I'm reading again, I'm not stressing the small things, I'm playing my video games, I'm working and I look forward to my work, I'm excited for myself and the future, I enjoy the little things in life, stop to smell the roses sometimes, ya know. I'm not as anxious anymore. I'm trying to stick to a schedule but that's kinda difficult cos my schedule got fucked up throughout the past year, but hey, progress is progress. 

I still have bad days, cause, life, right? But I'm confident enough in myself to know that I'll get through it. I got this. I'm happy, and I love it :)

For those of you that don't wash your hands after using the bathroom...,"I noticed a lot of guys at my job don't bother washing their hands after they piss. Then they go drink their coffee, type on their keyboard, push buttons on the vending machines and shake hands with Jim in finance.

Would you read an e-book if you aren't able to afford the physical copy at the moment?,"I've always read e-books if a physical copy isn't available to me for whatever reason. When I was, say, 14-15 I read my first book in English (it's not my native language as you might have guessed), and it was an e-book (Animal farm by George Orwell). Ever since then, I started reading them as they are convenient to read in public or when it's dark.

Don't get me wrong, I prefer physical copies over digital ones by far, but since I studied philology in high school, we had to read like 1 book per week and it would've been impossible to always either already have, buy or find in a library every single book that we were supposed to read. So, again, .epub and .pdf were always available to me.

I'm a huge Lord of the Rings universe fan. I've read The Silmarilion, The Hobbit, Unfinished Tales, The Fall of Gondolin and Children of Húrin - out of all these, I've only read The Fall of Gondolin as an e-book. Did I enjoy it less? Not quite. Would it have been better if I had it in real life? Absolutely.

As I said, I read all of those, but haven't read the most popular ones - The Lord of the Rings books. I've seen the movies countless of times and I'm literally going to rewatch it today again, but I just never had the chance to read it in person, in my own mother tongue. My English is really good (bold statement if you happen to find some major grammar mistakes here haha), and I have absolutely no trouble understanding it, but there's something about the translations of Tolkien's work to my language that buys me every time, it's so well done!

Should I wait until I'm able to afford the books (not soon, I'm broke af) or should I just read it on my phone? Should I do both? I'm kind of impatient hahah!

I'm not asking for advice only, I want to hear your opinions about e-books, do you ever read them usually? On your PC or on your phones?

TL;DR I don't know if I should wait until I can buy LOTR books or if I should just read them on my phone. Do you like e-books?

Sorry for the long text, I enjoyed expressing my feelings towards this entire situation :)",0
Been working on my social anxiety and made a connection..ish in public for the first time!,"Firat person, on the train, when we got off I asked if she'd got a new keyboard, (that shape of box), turns out it was a platter board for her sisters hen do this weekend, I wished her a good time and went on my way.

The second, I smiled at a girl at the bus stop and when we got on she smiled back, cue a couple more shared smiles during the ride, then heart breakingly she got off one stop before me as I was going to strike up a convo with her when we got off. Sad times.
But still, first time I think that in particular has ever happened and I wasn't a panicky mess thinking about the impending interaction I was actually looking forward to it!

Baby steps!",0
Finding A Home For Yourself,"These past few weeks have marked a significant change in how I've been viewing the world around me. To give you some context, I've always been the type of person who can't clearly see the forest for the trees; I easily get stuck in a small and insignificant moment that would go on for the next couple of weeks (or even months). Even an event or moment lasting for less than a minute was all it took for me to emotionally regress for the many months to come. As a result, I've developed this tendency to look back on my past instead of moving forward with where I want to go in life, eventually leading to this suffocating feeling of timelessness or motionlessness.

Amidst - or better yet, in spite of - all of this dark cloud that I conjured for myself, there would always be a part of me that sees the people, events, and objects around him in a profoundly imaginative way. For example, taking a trip to the grocery store. Nothing special here - just a few people working and picking up supplies for them to take home. But the way I see it, it's beautiful how simplistic and peaceful the events or stories happening inside a grocery store are all at once. I see a lineup of products lined on shelves and inside chillers for people to continue sustaining themselves. I see pairs and groups of people interacting with one another that would go a long way towards them not feeling lonely (even just for a short moment) once they get back home. I see a straight path in front of me whenever I enter a new aisle full of products to my left and right, encouraging me to walk forward and move on to the next aisle without spending too much time in one. These are just a few examples. There are plenty more, such as in the many times I jogged, noticing other people jogging along the same route as me to improve our physical and mental health. Or, when walking along a path of nature, the trees and vegetation that take up the majority of my central and peripheral visions are there to perhaps remind me of the stillness of things in a world that just won't stop buzzing.

My point is that allowing myself to see the world in this beautiful and kind way really went a long way toward lowering the intensity of the voices that keep playing in my mind. The same voices telling me that I'm not good enough, that I will never be worthy because of something that happened in the past. Are the voices still there at this very moment? Yes. In fact, sometimes, they take control of whatever emotional power I have over myself. As I mentioned earlier, I'm the kind of person that can't see the forest for the trees. I get stuck in a negative moment way too easily. But, it also allows me to see the hidden gem of a beautiful stream tucked within said forest, reminding me that there is beauty and hope amidst whatever dark cloud is resting above my head. Find that stream. Look around you, and I guarantee you there's something beautiful that only you can find meaning. Hold onto that. Your worldview will gradually blossom into a beautiful one where you can hopefully find a home for yourself. I sincerely hope you'll be able to find that place where you belong 💙",0

It makes me sad that people I have cared about have only been there for such short time,"What the title says. It's been on my mind for some time since I have just 1 more year of college until I go onto university. Over the last 10+ years I've been in school for, I've made so many great friends I've cared about a lot whom over time I have stopped talking to. Of course there are people who I've known for a while that are still in my life, but just events like moving from primary school to secondary school, and secondary school to college means that I lose contact with a lot of people. It makes me a bit sad thinking that most of our relationships are built based on proximity and just out of convenience - as soon as you move away from a place, you talk less and less to someone you used to talk to everyday, until you don't anymore completely. Or you and they stop speaking immediately.

Of course, this makes me want to spend more time with my friends and whatnot, making the most out of the time I have with them, but I'm really not looking forward to when I have to start all over again in university, maybe keeping in contact with 2 or 3 of my old friends.",0
Playing a US word game as a non-US English speaker.,"I play a lot of word games, but it's apparent most of them are US based. I know the US drops a lot of u's (colour/color, neighbour/neighbor etc.) They swap s's with z's (colonise/colonize, realise/realize etc.), then there's cultural things such as a main meal being called an entree.

For me, it feels like an extra level of the puzzle, because I don't think of these automatically.

Feeling Gouged,Staying at a run of the mill hotel for a weekend coming up at the end of July. Its in Vermont. We’ll be traveling from Canada. The cost is $780 for two nights. Holy shat. It’s basically the cheapest stayable hotel I could find at our destination. Seems like a lot of money just for breathing the air and eating a stale croissant for breakfast!!! It isn’t just this place….same hotel price gouging here in Canada. FWIW my wife and I flew to Iceland in 2019 for $1000.29 and thats total including return flight.

AAA game studios are swaying more and more toward open world and it’s getting kinda boring (imo),"A couple days after Elden Ring released, one of my friends and I were having a chat about the enormous potential Elden Ring has, considering Dark Souls has always been a franchise that doesn’t tell you shit about where to go (apart from certain hints), and that Elden Ring can amplify that feeling to a massive scale considering how large it is. 

She said while it looked good from the trailers, she’s afraid that a lot of AAA studios and famous titles are swaying more and more toward the open world concept and it’s getting sort of repetitive. 

I wanted to disagree because I like having fun chats with her, but I looked back to a bunch of games I’d played in the last four/five years and I realised something ridiculous.

Aside from the Call of Duty and Doom campaigns, so many of the titles in my collection could be called open world. Starting with Borderlands 2 and 3, Witcher 3, the Batman Arkham series, then more recently with Cyberpunk, and a bunch more games I’d played just a few months ago like Skyrim, Zelda BoTW, AC Valhalla. Hell, even God of War, which used to be linear as hell, has tons of side quests and objectives. Others include Far Cry 6, Watch Dogs Legion, the Tomb Raider games, RDR2, god knows what else. 

I really didn’t want her to be correct so I started going through my PlayStation discs. Out of my entire collection, I’d say only Bloodborne, Uncharted 4 and Returnal were non-open world. 

While I love open world games, it kinda raises a question. How much fluff are studios adding to keep me hooked? How many pointlessly extended side missions, bosses, and other shit have I done just because I could? I literally remember capturing every base in Just Cause 3, which was pretty much the same mission repeated 30 times. 

Anyone else wish we could have more level by level games, rather than a massive landscape filled with tons of side quests. 

P.S. yes I’m sure there’s tons of smaller studios making non-open world games, but I only have so much time and I like to use it to play whatever’s trending (and I usually end up enjoying it).",0
What are the ethics of keeping bugs in this manner?:,"Suppose someone wanted to collect common, local native insects inside a terrarium.
They would be fed, and their temperature would be a nice room temperature rather than swinging from hot to cold, they wouldn't experience flooding, drought, or frost. They would have plenty of cover and places to hide.

However, the tank would contain multiple species of arthropods. Spiders kept alongside earwigs and rollie-pollies and crickets and soil centipedes and beetles. Some animals would be preyed on. Just a little piece of the nature outside your house, but inside instead. For science. See how the populations inside flux over time. 

What are your thoughts on the ethics of keeping bugs in this manner? Right? Wrong? Something in between?",0
Nostalgia man,"Does anyone hear a certain song or get a moment of deja vu from a scenerio in life that brings you back to your childhood. 
I want to re experience so many childhood memories, I wanna be held and comforted. My childhood trauma started so early but even in between there's been so many moments I want to relive/refeel. 

We used to be homeless though also traveled with work via roadtrip, I specifically remember being curled up in a moving van with my dad singing to put me to sleep while he drived. I remember the night and the Florida highway lights going by and dreading how much further we had to go. He sang that lil dogie song from the 50s/60s. 

I remember living in California and meeting my first ever friend, while my dad worked all the time. Falling asleep to his cheapy radio with new mid 2000s music playing through the night on low, for his tinnitus. Smelling coffee early morning from his grandparents waking up before us. Going to anime conventions and going through my weeb phase with him and my sister. 

There's also a lot of anxiety filled and sad moments too though with my dad being a single parent, and coming home from work at 2am or being gone for weeks at a time (pilot and mechanic) while I fell asleep to nick at night. Waking up The Nanny early morning. My nostalgia is mostly a sad feeling rather than happy, but it still feels prefferable to be naive and relatively innocent. Compared to now, knowing how utterly terrible our world is and how void our existence is.",0
"Have you ever watched a movie that you disliked the first time, but thoroughly enjoyed the second time?","I first watched the Witch a few years ago. 2019, I think. I honestly didn't get it the first time. I thought it was just some corny rehash of basically every paranormal horror film ever made with a pretentious facade of Her Majesty's English on top. Review from my first time watching was a solid 1/10.

For some reason, though, I recently felt the need to give it a second chance. After doing just that, I honestly cannot believe how utterly wrong I was about it. There are so many subtle and ingeniously nuanced literary devices in the plot and dialogue. I'd argue that some of the irony, foreshadowing, and symbolism is nearly Shakespearean in tier. 

That on top of the fantastic cinematography makes this probably one of my favorite films right now. Easily 9/10. 

I feel like foolish for not realizing the depth of story telling the first time. But at least I know when to admit I was wrong, I guess?

What about you? Is there a movie you really didn't like until you rewatched it?",0
Nervous about my first tattoo," A bit more than a month ago, I scheduled an appointment for my first tattoo, and this weekend, I'm going in for the first of two four hour sessions.

Still, when I scheduled for it, a tattoo on *me* was very much still in the abstract. Now that I'm so much closer to it, my nerves are getting me to a bit. I really don't like needles, and I know it sounds silly, but somehow it didn't really hit me how involved in the process they are until now. Plus, some people have told me I chose a pretty painful spot. I'm still going through with it, but I'd appreciate any advice and reassurances from people more familiar with the process than I am.",0
How can I stop being too nice to people?,I am way too nice to people. I put up with so much of other people's stuff. So many people do things that I don't like at all to me. I allow myself to put up with way much more than I should. I put up with so much of other people's stuff in life and people do things that I hate. I allow people to disrespect me and walk all over me. People talk to me anyway and feel they can do whatever they want. They violate and cross my boundaries completely. They do things that I feel completely uncomfortable with. I want to know how I can stop being to nice to people.,0
"If you could bring anything you own in real life into a game, what would it be and why?","So there exists the question of ""what video game thing would you want in real life?"", but, what real life thing (that you already have) would you want to see in a game?

Anything (that you have in real life) being in any game of your choosing. Why that choice, and why that game? Assume it'd follow gameplay ""rules"", so for example a bicycle in Halo would support the weight of a 1,000 pound/400 kilo Spartan. And also assume you have whatever is necessary to operate/maintain it. Your car includes the keys, for example.

I think I'd choose my lightsaber to bring into Minecraft. It's a high quality prop lightsaber, not durable enough for being a weapon, but it's very bright and can change colors. Basically like a reusable torch but better.

Too much coffee!!,"I barely drink any coffee (maybe once a week) but when I do, it's usually just plain coffee with no milk, cream, sugar etc. I've had two cups of coffee today and boy am I feeling it!! #kwazyenergy 😅",0
Random memory time. I wonder if I was in the wrong or not.,"Context: I forgot who they were despite being in the same class for a year. Please not that I have barely talked to them. Ever. I am also really bad at memorising people, especially if we have never interacted.

I will also be using fake names.

So during physics on a Tuesday, I forgot what happened but I said something aming the lines of ""Who's Ava?"". In turn, the physics teacher said that it was rude of me to forget her while I struggled to explain why I forgot her. Or I didn't struggle but that didn't get to her, I can't remember.

So Ava is with this small group of gals (I think 3 total or at least my practical classes-wise). So after that day, they have started to well.. Ah..

So soon after that (I think) they were like ""Hey Max (me) *giggle* do you know who I am?"" I didn't respond. Also it was close to break ending and I was contemplating on going to the bathroom or not. I was also kind of scared since going to the bathroom was also a fight or flight response (seriously I did want to go)

This round of questions continued and I was getting more nervous. So this happened. I ran away, into the long way to the bathrooms saying this loudly ""I'M SORRY, I DON'T REMEMBER YOU!!!"" While bursting hallway kinda full with my fellow students. Also did I mention the guy I had a squish on was there? With his/my fellow boarders, talking with each other. So yeah, both parties of students heard. Hah..


So yeah, this is relatively minor but I was wondering if I should've done that or not.

Also here's another example that happened waaay after. Sadly, they found out that I was kinda scared of them.

Again, more context. I speak multiple languages such as English and Chinese (Cantonese majorily and Mandarin. I'm from a Cantonese-speaking place). And more! But I mostly speak Cantonese with my fellow boarders and I am not the best at it (should've concentrated during class)

So AGAIN, another Physics class and we're waiting for the teacher so we can go in. I was reading a manga (Detective Conan) in Chinese.

Again my Chinese isn't that great so I always go to the Bucci Stan (guy I have a squish on. I call him that because we are fellow jojo fans. I'l explain this if you want me to) for Chinese help since he is better at it. Also I have a squish on him so I go to him instead of the other boarder. :>

(The Bucci Stan either trolls or something like that or tells me a random word that isn't the meaning or actually says the word. Which is most of the time. Actually it's tied with trolling??? Wither way I guess he doesn't mind but I worry I may annoy him like I did with Jojo. I cannot tell sarcasm I swear.)

So at this point, Ava and her gaggle of witches started to say whatever I say in Cantonese, even if it is not vulgar (I am not very foul-mouthed so every time they have done this I usually have said something like sandwich) is vulgar. Not saying I want to give them the benefit of the doubt but Cantonese to me is an optimal swearing language so...

Either way I go and ask the Bucci Stan the meaning of this word. The girls, who happened to be next to him said ""Oohh... Max. That is so inappropiate! *giggle*"".

I backed off the my side of the corridor. Away from those awful... [word that isn't vulgar but can be used as a swear word noun].


Uhh... That's it. I don't have that much but I do have another that I can remember. It's the summer holiday now so I don't have to see those bitches for 2 months!

Yay I called them bitches :D Look, they were doing this for no reason except I forgot their names, okay. 

TL,DR: Forgot some girls name and now they start bullying me. Something like that. Now I' wondering if one of the actions I did was bad or not.

Also I feel this this may break a rule. Sorry if it does.

What is the smallest place you've lived in?,"When I was a student, I lived in a dorm and my room was only nine square meters. Now I'm renting my own place and it's pretty small too, around 30 square meters altogether.

Apparently, in most big cities there is not enough space for construction, and land prices are through the roof. That's why we have such tiny apartments and the rent is still expensive.

But I've just discovered from this [documentary](https://t.me/rtdocfilms/213) that a lot of people have it much worse. 

For example, in Hong Kong, which is one of the most densely populated places in the world, people huddle in rooms as small as two square meters (slightly bigger than a coffin).

Just a random thought,"I recently lost one of my best friends and have been lost in my thoughts a lot. Some of them involve reminiscing about old memories and some of them strange space thoughts

I used to talk random 3am drunk hyper philosophical questions with him. 

I did have a random thought I'd like to share

We are 4 dimensional beings moving along a 3 dimensional space

If viewed as a horizontal vector it would be [ x y z time(+)] 

Well I was thinking about the idea of quantum immortality, and the observation theory

If the 4 dimension of the vector would represent location in space & time would the fifth point be existence/energy state and sixth point be observation 

So let's say I'm currently at physical location ( 0 0 0 ) at current point in time +33 and energy state human whatever that may be let's say 3 and observed his passing so 1 as it's fully observed

So my multiverse point would be [ 0 0 0 +33 3 1 ...]  ie in this universe I have observed his passing so it is set.

But what if in another universe in the multiverse it is another vector point whereby he is not gone. 

Then I had the thought that there can be many universes that forms the make up of 1 multiverse. But does the multiverse encompass all things. Is there a multiverse whereby his energy state never existed to begin with? Can things exist outside the multiverse concept? 

Who knows? I'm not high or drunk. I think I just miss my friend

My cat just did something incredibly smart,"So I have hermit crabs and their tank was originally a fish tank but I never got around to changing the lid to a reptile one. The lid has a towel and a box of my art supplies on top of it but theres still a pretty big hole in the lid where a filter would go. I know that hermit crabs can be escape artists but I’ve had them for 4 years and they’ve never tried anything so I’ve never been concerned about them escaping. My cat was asleep on my dresser across from my bed and I was laying down trying to sleep, when she suddenly got up, jumped on my bed, put her paws on my shoulder and rubbed on my face enthusiastically. I petted her for a bit and then she walked the the end of my my bed, looked at the floor where the tank is and then came back and rubbed on me again. After she did this a few times I was getting super confused bc she’s normally not like this so I sat up and just happened to look over at my tank to see one of the crabs about to fall out. The crab hadn’t made any noise and I probably wouldn’t have noticed until morning that one of them was missing, and by then she could’ve been anywhere in the room and I might not’ve been able to find her. As soon as I got the crab back in the tank, my cat went back to her spot and immediately fell back asleep. I’m very aware of how smart she is, but sometimes she really just blows my mind 😄

TLDR: my cat alerted me to one of my hermit crabs making an escape attempt",0

Driving Down A Hill and the Steering Wheel Doesn’t Work: Driving/moving anxieties. I didn’t used to have to drive a lot, so whenever I knew I needed to rent a car in the future it would be on my mind for days.

Forgetting to Wear Socks to School: I don’t know why, but any time I’m stressed about work or school, I dream that I forgot to put socks on and its a BIG DEAL. Its obvious that no one in the school notices and it doesn’t affect my in-dream school day at all, but I swear I can feel my heart racing when it happens.",0
"Do you ever just get oddly nostalgic over a part of your life, even if it isn't so different from your life right now?","Like, right now I just can't help but remember a year ago or so. I went to school in the local college with, regular zoom classes and friendly professors. I finished class and spent the rest of the day chatting with my girlfriend, and helping each other with homework. All this to the tune of this Christian radio station I used to just have playing on an old phone I left charging on a desk.

Life just *made sense.* I was *happy.*

I was a simply guy, I'd wake up, log in to class, do homework and chat with *her*, all with a nice soundtrack in the background. Maybe spice things up a bit with a walk to the park and a bunch of nice pictures of turtles and ducks occasionally.

I mean like, life for me hasn't changed all that much since then. I still go to school, I still live in the same place, etc etc but it just doesn't *feel* the same. So many little things have changed that I can't help but miss when those little things were the way they were. I go to a different school now with no zoom classes and almost no interaction with anyone else. My relationship didn't quite work out and now we're just distant friends. My favorite hidden little spot in the park became overgrown and inaccessible. My Shadow subscription ran out just as I got a new computer, so even that's different. Heck, the old phone went missing too, and so the 24/7 soundtrack of my life is gone with it :(

I know my life hasn't changed much, but I still *miss* the way things were.

Anyone else get this feeling?",0
What are your bad habits that your partner tolerates?,"I’ll go first. I pick my skin A LOT. I know it’s bad to pop pimples but I seriously can’t help myself. I pick my skin so bad I have acne scars all over, and when my skin breaks out I pick even more making skin look really bad. I also like twirling/ twisting my hair, to the point I’m pulling my hair out. My husband kindly tries to get me to stop but I can’t. Picking my face and pulling out my hair is very soothing to me lol without thinking about it I do it. My tries to get me to stop but he just lets me be. But if it gets bad he’ll say something to me. Oh I also used to pick at my eyelashes. I would put a ton of mascara just so I can pick at it. To the point I was pulling my lashes out. I know, it’s bad. What about you guys?",0
do late bloomers exist?,"I say this because it's been on my mind lately. I always see ""late bloomer post"", but these figures they point out usually had a head start, or have been doing said thing since they were babes.

examples being (actors) alan Rickman, and Harrison Ford, who had extensive training from young age

examples(artists) van Gogh, Claude Monet, and grandma Moses. they all had extensive training Monet recognized for giftedness at 13 or 11 years of age. van Gogh's mom was an art teacher who shared her love for art with him from a young age, he did start painting at an older age, but drew and did other stuff till then. Grandma Moses loved painting and art since she was young, just finally got to get recognition for it at an old age.

example (science figures) Einstein. Maybe the best example of this. he was a star and a hard worker, but you always see ""well Einstein failed math too""  his grades were astounding.

 

do ""late bloomers"" have any hope? is there even such a thing? are some just doomed to never live a fulfilling life?",0
Wondering what mantras you all live your lives by. Care to share them?,"So I've been thinking about the different phrases or thoughts that I use to keep myself motivated and focused in life.  For example, a phrase that is consistently going through my head these days is ""There's a difference between LOOKING great and BEING great.  That difference is character and integrity.""  This has helped me a lot when other people have tried to call me out for mistakes and when they try to put me down because I don't play office politics with them.

I'm retaking a class next semester in college and I'm genuinely excited to retake it,"I'm majoring in health science in college. It requires Anatomy and Physiology 1 and Anatomy and Physiology 2, where 1 is more gross anatomy and 2 is focused more on physiology. I had originally planned on going to PT school after I graduate, but I was having second thoughts. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and was incredibly unmotivated. I absolutely bombed A&P1 and ended up with a D, and got a C in A&P2.

I had been toying with the idea of becoming a dietician until my dad told me that it made no sense why I wouldn't want to be a PT. I've gotten really into lifting the past year and PT is pretty closely related to it. I ended up shadowing at a PT place this summer and I've realized that I really want to go into this field and I'm genuinely excited about going to PT school.

After the first PT shadowing session I realized this, and decided that a D in anatomy would really hurt my chances of getting into PT school. A C probably won't make it easy either, but a D is way worse. I emailed my advisor and he CC'd the registrar and they got me into the last open seat in A&P1. Now that I know I for sure want to go into this field, I'm genuinely excited to retake this class and do well in it.",0
I made a whole cicada 3301 enigma for my gf.,"She likes enigmas , not that much , but enjoys it , so , why not do one just to make her day?

I asked her parents (which I'm kinda living with them as of now because of a family problem in my own house) to pretend they made it for her. Well , this  enigma required going outside and I wanted to be with her and see her ""what the fuck is even that"" face , that's why. If she knew I made , then wouldn't be as good because she would ask me everything and it wouldn't be as good.

We spent all the day long doing this and when she read the final message 7 feet under the ground she made the most wholesome face I've ever seen (not even ahegao , tho).

Btw , I spent like 7 months for this , I started when we weren't even dating yet. Everyday when I went back home I always at least thought about the stuff I could put in the enigma and all that stuff.

I have to tell my best friend I can’t make it to her wedding how do I break the news?,"My best friend is getting married in a week in another state I was going to fly there for the wedding to be there on the big day. I was asked to be a bridesmaid too so I am part of the wedding party. I am 4 months pregnant but it doesn’t show and I’m still really active so I wasn’t worried about that effecting the wedding. However my dr just told me my placenta is extremely low and internally bleeding I’m being referred to a specialist at a hospital as we speak. She very firmly asked me not to travel under any circumstance. I know my friend would be very understanding but I want to break it to her as gently as possible can anyone write up a little draft to send?

Edit: thank you to everyone who pushed me to call my friend. She answered immediately she was super understanding and said she isn’t worried about the wedding at all she is just worried about me and my baby and to keep her updated what happens. I am happy I can stress about one less thing.",0

Do you ever feel like you are never good enough to deserve good things in life?,"I dont understand why my brain is wired like this. I cant seem to feel good for long periods of time about what I've accomplished. Ive been in my career for a while, i started my own company at one point and just kept grinding, I have a lot of love for my career. I had many failures and lots of lessons learnt while operating as a sole proprietor. Over the years, I hit quite a few accomplishments, just kept going up in my field. But I dont understand, everytime something good happens to me, I feel like I dont deserve any of this, im a nobody but I still love my career. Recently I hit a major accomplishment and its like my brain is just like so what man? Your a nobody, you dont deserve this, your not good enough at what you do and youll never be good enough, its just luck. And then instead of feeling proud...

What are your plans for the next year?,"So from now until next summer, what are your plans?

Here are some of my plans: I am going to hopefully start working out with a personal trainer again to get back in shape and feel better about myself. I am hopefully going to find either another part time job or a full time job. Finally, I am going to delve further in my music career and make my first EP. 

Out of all of those things, I'm most excited to do the EP as making music is something I really enjoy. I'm aiming to start recording the songs for it in Jan/Feb 2023 and then maybe it could get released in April/May 2023.

I really want to walk somewhere on my own,"So, I'm a female minor and I'm not allowed to leave my house by myself (unless I'm catching one of our dogs that got off the property, and I've only ever gone 3 houses down). We have a big backyard and I've already explored all of it. And to be honest I'm getting kinda sick of being at home all the time. I want to just walk somewhere. Granted when Im at my grandma's house I'm allowed to walk to the park that's two streets down but I always have to bring my sister and I want to go alone.
 It's an urge thats been growing stronger after summer break started and I don't have school to keep me busy all day. I've been dropping tips to my parents and even asked my mom but she brushed it off. It may be the moody teenager side kicking in but I'm getting kinda frustrated and Im starting to feel trapped in my own house.

"I was feeling down, I went to the grocery store, I feel a bit better.","So I won't go into what's got me down, but check this out: I sneezed and someone called out, ""Bless you."" That should have been such a mundane moment, forgotten immediately, I looked around and couldn't even figure out who said it. But damn, I was seen and heard; I am in the world with people who give a shit, even on menial levels. I'm always friendly to strangers and in public, even if I'm feeling sad or upset, I'd like to think it adds to the net positive of the world not being shitty. Everyone at the grocery store was so nice to me, and I to them. I didn't realize it at the time, and I have no one to which to talk about it right now (hence my post here), and at the risk of rambling, here is my thought: it makes sense for us to be kind to each other. Not just in a moral way, but on a material and evolutionary level. We have only gotten as far as we have as a species from being kind. Yes, there is destruction and brutality, hatred and people doing unimaginable shitty things to each other as I type this. But perhaps, in spite of the terrible things humans do, we might be generally good. Maybe. I'd like to hear other's thoughts.

My Best Friend has become argumentative and it's suffocating,"I'm 18 and have a good friend who I text and interact with frequently, but there's just one thing about his character that drives me insane: his random argumentative bursts. Sometimes I text him something lighthearted, like a ridiculous Instagram post, and while he usually indulges in the humor, that isn't always the case. 

Like today, I sent him a ridiculous job posting with a tiny pay and he immediately took a logistic standpoint and started giving reasons as to why the pay was justifiable when I wasn't even looking to argue. Another example is when he asked me if I knew the name of some US war general during our conversation and I randomly gave some name as a joke, to which he responded with ""how the actual fuck would that even make any sense? Like can you please explain that?"", and proceeded to ignore the fact that I was joking, even when I started getting visibly annoyed at his argumentative mood. The last example is when we were playing with his toddler brother and I made a lighthearted joke about how his brother burst into laughter in response to a scalp massage. My friend responded, ""Well obviously he's gonna respond that way, it's a strange feeling for him, yadayadayada"". 

And when I call him out on it and ask him why he has to react in such a stuck-up way, he gets super defensive and continues trying to get his points across. Now this is a very good friend who has done a lot of good for me, so this will NOT be a friendship-breaker, but it's really getting to me because he just was not like this a year or two ago. And it's not like he's going through anything either, as our parents are super close and his parents are amazing people who support him in anything. I just for the life of me cannot figure out why he has these random moments where he feels the need to argue for absolutely zero reasons, even if I talked to him about it multiple times. Can anyone advise please? :(",0
I think I got scammed and now I have trust issues,"So basically two weeks ago this dude who was a student in my college(allegedly) called me and asked for some financial help to cover his father's cancer treatment surgery expenses. He said he got my number from my department and was reaching out to my seniors and classmates to collect as much money as possible within a few days. 
I asked him if there is any funding campaigns where I can read about the condition and donate for which he said that it will take atleast a week to get verified in those websites and he needed the money within a few days. So I naively donated him money from the very little balance i have in my account and also gave a few contact info of my friends. 
Today I get a message from our department saying that there has been an ongoing scam where some dudes make up stories about needing medical funding and ask for money from students who recently loaded a job. Apparently it has been happening for the last two years. 
As someone who's friend went through the same situation recently, I did not think someone could so low for money.
Im extremely disgusted at this dude and I'm not gonna trust anyone the same way anymore.

Am I way too naive/new to this situation or is it a common scam strategy to pretend to have a dying dad for money.",0
Conversational tips for being discreet about how much I earn without being obviously evasive,"I’ll start working soon as a lawyer with a corporate law firm. The job pays well.

What music do you guys recommend for an (almost) first time listener?,"I'll spare you guys the details, but basically I was born into an extremely strict religious family that had many rules.

Do you think there's a downside to being confident and proud about yourself all the time?,"It seems like the prevailing motto is ""be proud of you who you are all the time no matter what"" and that sounds great if you're a normal good person. But what about if you're an asshole? I feel like there are people who are assholes and they can be better people if they wanted to, but they don't. They also hear this motto and live by it. So is that just a necessary evil or should we try to change the motto?

Because it's not always true that you should be proud of yourself all the time. Most people aren't, that's why we have to repeat this mantra in our minds. What if you did a really despicable thing even by accident. Are you meant to be proud then too? I don't think so. So why do we say be proud always no matter what? Why can't we handle just being proud when we're doing the right things?  What could be the benefit of unconditional pride?

I guess the confusion is when other people tell us what right and wrong is and what's normal and abnormal. It seems like a tough issue to get a hold on so I guess that's why we just say always be proud and it works for people unfortunately including the jerks.",0
high school reunion,"Did you go to your high school reunion? I'm especially wondering about people who (like me) never had many friends. 

I graduated in 2019 and now there's a reunion coming up in September. Really not sure if I'll go there. I really don't care about 90% of these people and some of them I never want to see again to be honest. The 2 friends that I have are people that I see somewhat regularly anyway.

My one friend is also not sure about going and I know she'd feel uncomfortable with meeting some of these people again. But my other friend wants us to come and doesn't understand why we're so hesitant. I mean, she got along with most people cause she's friendly and generally easy to get along with.

It was just a fun little moment of self discovery with my favorite person. The realization doesn't change anything and lead to a pretty fun conversation about how I navigate the world.  An example would be the unspoken laws of social interaction. I keep a mental checklist on how to generally interact with people. I literally thought everyone did this and that I just sucked at it.",0

I had a close friend tell me I inspired him to make sure he compliments people when they deserve it and that made my year.,"Thanks to quite a few near-death experiences throughout my experience with addiction, I've always tried to go out of my way to make sure that the people around me know that I appreciate them. 

Whether that's my family, coworkers or friends, I'll go out of my way to consistently tell them I love them, appreciate their hard work or appreciate their friendship. I'll tell people when their jokes were particularly funny or clever, I'll compliment them when they make an intelligent argument if we're debating something, or I'll tell them their new haircut/clothes looks good. That kind of stuff. I just know how that stuff makes me feel and I like making other people feel that way. 

But it absolutely thrilled me to hear that I had rubbed off on my friend and that he was now going around making sure the people in his life knew how much he loved them. We need more of that shit.",0

"I have wondered this for long so here it goes: People of all nations, do you find your own mother tongue cringy? And what about hearing someone speak English with your native accent?","I don't know why, but I physically cringe whenever I hear anybody speak my native language (German), and I wanna know if it's the same for people from other countries too? Or is there something about the German language & accent that makes it particularly cringier than others?

So my questions to you:

1. Do you cringe when you hear someone speaking your mother tongue? And which language is it?
2. Is it only with certain dialects, or even with the ""main""/pure form of your language? Or both?
3. If yes and you do find your language cringy: Do you too enjoy your language more when you listen to/watch media from decades ago, say WW2-era? (Imo even German sounded nice back then, but I also noticed American English sounds a lot different on old media compared to today.)
4. When non-native people speak English, in my opinion, every accent sounds very cute. Say for example when Japanese or French or Spanish people speak English, it is either cute or sexy or whatever. Heck even Indian accent sounds kinda cute. But with German.. I physically cringe the more noticeable the accent. Is this the same for other languages or is it only German?

I’m scared of becoming evil,"I’m remember when I was little I used to always like heroes when defending a person.Now I feel nothing and feel like I lack empathy.I’m scared that I’ll eventually reach a point because I’ve become ignorant and uncaring and just do things whenever I want to and try to not care about people.When something bad happens to someone I seem unbothered and usually mind my business.I’m just scared because my emotions aren’t as strong as they used to be and rarely can feel any.I used to be more compassionate/caring when I was younger.But at times before now I had thrills of what happened if I did something bad since I was always a good person 


I sometimes wonder if the reason if I was born this way too because remember when kicked my own dog when I was little because my brother laughed that it tripped me from the chain and enjoyed it later but asked myself what I was doing it while my body was shaking with fear but later hugged it.I feel like I wouldn’t feel the same if I did something bad but always try to avoid bad situations as much as I can.",0

Then I see my parents who are in their late 60s telling us stories from time to time, or when I see people talking about their dad/mom in father's day by mentioning how they were role models or affecting them as they grow up.

I'm always surprised whenever my mom tells a story about me when I was 8yo for example when I don't remember it. If you ask me ""how was your dad/mom as you grow up?"" I can't answer cause I don't remember, like if they taught me a lesson or a funny moment.

I might stay at the hotel during first birthday of my youngest daughter,"My wife is inviting two other families (let's call them family A and B) to celebrate first birthday of our youngest daughter.

I have a problem with it. I despise the B family. They are loud, obnoxious, very opinionated. They don't talk, they shout. God forbid we ever bring up any children-related experiance conversation, because they will immediately one-up us (or the other family) ""well yeah, and now imagine how much worse would that be if you had 3 kids like we do!""

But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what the reason is, I just hate being around them. We visited them a few times, because we are expats and my wife was keen to establish a relationship with other expats from our country. She wanted to connect with other young moms and I absolutely get it. I problably woudn't be writing this if only family A was invited.

My wife suggested that I can go and hide in our office for the duration (probably around 4 hours). I feel uncomfortable doing that. I would still hear the guests, and secondly, it kinda seems like pretending? I don't know, it just doesn't sit right with me. I have this internal expectation within me, that if I am at home, I should be fullfilling my host duties. And also I feel responsible for my kids. 
Lastly, hiding inside my own house from guests... I dunno. It feels wrong to be hiding inside my own house.

What I think I will do, is I will try to celebrate the birthday (I mean, the event isn't even on the day of birthday, it's just on the convenient Sunday) before the guests arrive. I feel like it's important for me to do that to show the older daughter that I care about important milestones of my kids. And then I am planning to leave and spend the rest of the day in a hotel room with a laptop to keep me entertained.

Am I crazy? Am I letting down my family?  I am open to hear comments from strangers about that. I am worried how this will be perceived and rememberd by my 5 year old.

My wife seemed to be okay with that idea when I first said that I am thinking about it. Of course she would prefer for me to stay in the office if given the choice...
I also talked about it with my therapist. She commented, that whatever I choose, I should not stay at the event and be angry.",0

West World S4               - June 26 

Only Murders in the Building S2 - June 28 

Stranger Things S4V2    - July 1 \*

Albeit \* ones had all their episodes released at once. All the others are on weekly basis and it’s so much fun to have something to look forward to. I loved almost everything above.

I know that these days, unless a project is impeccable without ANNYYY plotholes, then only it is being considered a good one. To be honest, am not a fan of such intricate criticism. I believe that any creator of any type of art shouldn’t feel pressurized to change their vision. I commend healthy and constructive criticism but if we are going to find fault in every little plot point, we will just end up being miserable even when we have such vibrant stories to experience.

The best part about the above tv shows, although it may look a bit overly stuffed for some viewers, I absolutely love the way each show is different in its own way.

I want to list out something the shows did that I would love discussing with.

* I thoroughly appreciated how Stranger things creators have found a way to show that everyone of their huge cast is important to the end goal, thus bypassing lot of issues caused by COVID.
* In regards with Obi-Wan Kenobi, I am relieved and excited about the way Star Wars universe is being explored. They have played the game of prequels and sequels but did not over do it. They are not reviving the universe by bringing a known interesting character and their stories. Rather they are bringing seldom known characters with interesting stories, which are not only making the old fans happy but the newer fans do not have to deal with keeping up with continuity.
* What can I say about The Boys, Diabolical is the perfect word. Who would have thought an exaggerated take on serious implications of superhumans would resonate THIS close to real life? 
* There are multiple things I love about Umbrella Academy. 

1. Where The boys is , well.. The Boys, UA is a wonderful take on a dysfunctional family who just so happen to be possess superpowers. This is a show that perfectly portrays the dynamic of siblings, be it petty squabbles, or the extreme protection or the matter-of-factness, everything. Minus the fights & romance, I watch all the scenes over and over. Its like being with my sibling. 
2. I love what they did with the cast. I have never seen such a diverse cast in a while with such strong characters. They roped in the cast from different ethnicities and backgrounds, siblings I understand but the actor who played Lila being a person from South Asian-descent, they definitely had a checklist. The best of all was despite being from different ethnicities, the characters never feel different even given their outrageous childhood.

* Only Murders in the Building brought such a fresh perspective in narration. Its not just about the detectives solving a crime, its about learning bits and pieces of each detective through the lens of the crime. Which truly came off as simple cheery true crime lovers satisfying their famous five/hardy boys fascination but as the show progressed every viewer goes ""wait, what?"". I feel that the  choice of the cast is simply genius. Its unusual, unexpected, draws attention and hilarious. Scenarios like this make me go, casting directors are the artists that fill in colors to make ART. Cos not in million years would I have thought of that pairing.
* Ms Marvel is the opposite of The Boys. In a superhero reality, it shows how a teen idolizes superheroes and finds solace and comfort in them. Adding a certain layer of character and diversity, they showed a first gen American teen girl of South Asian descent struggling with her identity and expectations. Definitely an overlooked aspect of portrayal. 
* The comfort shows I watch multiple times are always subjected to skip forward. But, West World, I had to watch every season twice and only then watch the next season. Cos you blink, you miss a detail. Phew, but I am not even mad about it. The level of thought behind every scene and the stellar acting makes it all worth it. I will not open discussion for this show, although I love this one the most, because until I am done with the second watching of COMPLETE SEASON 4, I will not be equipped to speak about it at all.

This has been a LONG post. Sorry for that. I would love to talk about any show and any detail I mentioned. I am super up for your thoughts.",0

How do you like your steak?,"Hey it's me again. Bacon, peanut butter, now ***STEAK***?

Yes it is true folks, today's question is about *steak*. How do you like it? Or do you eat steak?

This time there are plenty of options to choose from so make your choice wisely. There is no correct choice so please take your time.

I prefer my steak to be medium rare because I think that is when the steak is the most tender and the most flavorful. It is at this point that the steak requires no BBQ or anything to be added as it is already a great steak. Which leads me to today's *bonus question*...

BONUS QUESTION: Do you add anything to your steak to make it better? If so, what do you add? (assuming you eat steak)

If for some reason you do not eat steak, feel free to let me know what you would substitute steak with, if anything. Your reason for not eating steak is respected.

Thank you, and I look forward to seeing the end results and reading all of your lovely little comments.

But as of recently i've been dreaming of my crush (she's bisexual) and in the dream me and her we go out driving together to a beach and she confesses her love to me but i know ikr she has a girlfriend and is in a committed long term relationship, we both talk a lot and its kinda messing with my head a bit, and its making me upset and i don't really know whether I should cut my ties to make this dream stop.",0
Does anyone else have dreams they are not in?,"I recently had, for the first time, a dream that I was not in. It was kind of like watching a movie. It was about spies who were ramping up to go to a very cold country (I can't remember which one) to stop some bad guys. I don't recall watching any movies or TV shows along these lines. But the oddest part was that none of the people in the dream were me. I typically am always in my dreams. Sometimes I morph from one person to another, but I have never not been in my own dreams. Has this ever happened to other people?

Edit: It's evening where I am, but I will do what I can to respond tomorrow if I can't respond this evening. ",0
Stranger Things...,"Whoa! What a roller coaster that last episode was. Or season in general. But that last episode! And 2.5 hours...wow.

Anyone else feeling the same??",0

Watching movies without checking out the trailer first makes the experience so much better,"Generally speaking, it does. That being said, I understand that many people would need to check out the trailer in order to understand whether they’re interested in the movie. I think the approach that is best for me is reading the synopsis and checking out the ratings of a movie in order to decide whether I want to watch it or not. 

I always used to watch trailers before the actual movie but there were three exceptions to this and I really didn’t regret it. 

One was Moon (2009), another was The Guilty (2018), and the other was Pet Sematary (2019). 

In the case of moon, I encountered a plot twist that I didn’t see coming which is actually in the trailer and it blew my mind while watching the movie since I really didn’t see it coming. In the case of The Guilty, I had zero expectations and chose a random movie and loved the overall mystery and atmosphere of the movie. In the case of Pet Sematary, that movie shocked me due to its fucked up plot which is basically spoon fed to you in the trailer. 

I watched the trailers of the above three movies after watching the actual movies and could see that my experience would have been half as good if I watched the trailers BEFORE watching the movies. 

I really recommend you guys try this. Find a movie that has really good rating and read the synopsis (or something shorter) and just put the movie on if you think it’s something you might enjoy. I bet you would be pleasantly surprised.",0
Why do you or don’t you make your bed in the morning?,"I never make my bed unless I just washed my bedding so I put it all on all nicely. Or if I have a friend coming over then I’ll clean my room and make my bed.

But I definitely don’t make my bed every morning. Because why would I? 

Maybe it’s because I’m a teen so my bed room is where I am most of the day. Like at my desk or on my bed is where I am if I’m at home.

Maybe it’s different for adults that have their own place? Because than you can chill out anywhere in the house not just your bedroom

Idk yea I don’t make my bed every morning and that’s why

For others is it just a habit? Or do you enjoy it? Or what?

When I’m at my moms house she makes me make my bed. But I’m usually at my dads house because that’s close to where my school is and he doesn’t care if I make my bed or not",0
There's a wasp trapped in my closet so now I don't want to open it,"I'm pretty sure it's a wasp, I didn't get a good look at it. When I saw it fly into my closet I just closed it. Wasps scare me so much and I have no idea how it got in my room. But what if I get someone to help kill it and I open the door and it doesn't come out? 

Guess I don't need the shirts in there anyway lol.",0
I failed my road test for the 5th time today from a malfunction. Anyone else who had to take a lot of road tests?,"I just feel like the universe wants me to fail and I feel awful. Something always went wrong. In the past I got the time wrong, I messed up one maneuver, and these things are a real pain to schedule so it sucks to wait a month or 2 just to fail. This time I was ready to go and going through the motions of turning on my car when my mirrors stopped working and I sat there for like 5 minutes trying to fix it when the test conductor left and told me to try again next time. 
And it sucks that I don’t know anyone else who took the test more than 3 times, or seeing people younger than me brag about getting it first try. Did anyone else have to take it a bunch of times? I just want to know I’m not the only one.",0
Phrases I NEVER Want to Hear Again,"I dont know if I am just getting old (F, 26) but I get so teeth-grindingly annoyed when I hear any of these phrases or words: 

""Oh you have *insert thing here*? Y'all didnt bring me any??"" -Someone You Dont Know

""Leadership"" *eyeroll* 

""Think outside the box""

""Let me piggyback off of that...""

""What time is it""? ""Time for you to get a watch."" 

""My *insert thing here* hurts"" ""can i stomp on your foot to get your mind off of it?""

just put in my resignation notice whoooo,"Well, a few hours ago. I haven't opened my email again cause im afraid to see the reaction lol. I'll just wait until work hour tomorrow. 


Anyway, I still have to work another 2 months cause my workplace requires 2 months notice. But yeah, im kinda hyped, but also kinda sad. I've become close friends with two of my coworkers. I'll miss them, im gonna move out of the city though unfortunately :(

How do people that work in the trades deal with the impact it has on your body?,"I know this probably is pretty job specific but It blows my mind how hard and long some people can work. I 23(M) recently got a more hands on job in my field and as a arborist/landscaper for a small tree farm and spend most of my time dragging brush,pruning trees or trimming grass. I work 5 day weeks 10 hour days and the work has started to really take a toll on my body. The physical strain aside I really love my job it's straight forward and very rewarding with little to no mental strain. But I wake up everyday with hands and legs so stiff it take about an hour before I get proper movement in my hands and knees again. I feel like I'm being dramatic because my boss is 63 and not only can out work me but almost litteraly runs everywhere. Anyway does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? I've been thinking of trying some workout supplements to help with muscle recovery and energy but am not sure where to start lol",0
You ever wake up feeling like you got hit by a train but you didn’t even do anything wild the day before?,"Cause that’s my day today. Currently at work trying to figure out how to be human when it’s 100°, and the air feels like coming out of a lava shower and putting a wet towel over your face. 

Definitely could go for a reset on today… or like a 5 day nap. Anyone else having this kinda day? Or is it just me?",0

"feeling down, but optimistic?","I just need to get a few things out somewhere, and the anonymous nature of reddit helps.

Ive been battling depressive episodes my entire life. A roller coaster, as life does. Im in collage for the summer to complete a few classes so i can go back to my dream collage for chiropractic. I am a groundskeeper at a carwash, hard work, but pays well, especually for a 19 year old kid living at home. 

Ive had an issue with my stomach for a few months now, where i need to burp, but cant and it gets so bad i go into a panic attack at points. I feel like i have to keep tums near me at all times. I quit drinking soda because its been affecting my weight and blood sugar (prone to low blood sugar), but that seems to be the fastest relief. 

It seems like even my own body is letting me down, and im not even in the prime of my life. If this is how im living, what is in store for me in the future?",0
"Put a ""No Cell Phone"" sign in your room","If you have a room you use to study, read, write, or perform other creative acts, put a sign on the door to remind you that cell phones are not allowed. It will help you avoid distractions. (If you believe that won't work, switch to a dumb phone that takes a current network).",0
It’s my first day on a job I’ve desperately needed. I didn’t show up.,"They said the new employee orientation would be hosted online first thing this morning. I attended the meeting and everything went great.

My supervisor (who hasn’t contacted me until just now) called to ask why I wasn’t at the office 😳 Uhhhhh, I never received instructions to be in-office today… I checked my email, text messages, and all the forms I signed. Nope. Nothing.

This position is 80% remote as well. I’m just baffled on why they expected me today when the office is two hours away and the only instructions I received was to attend an online meeting? How would I have even attended the online-only meeting if I were in the office without a designated work area?

Half of me is freaking out. The other half is just going, “…Seriously?”",0
What are your favorite TV shows from a foreign languge ?,"I was finding new TV shows to watch for improving my languge skills and suddenly I thought it may be interesting to see what are some foreign TV shows that others love ?

If you aren't English what is your favorite English TV show ?
It doesn't matter what languge it is or if it's famous or not.  Just interested in knowing your favorites .",0

My 16 year search for something I was told didn’t exist finally paid off,"Do you ever have one of those things that you know existed but no one can confirm it? I’m not one to let things go so this particular movie Iast watched on VHS in 2004 has driven me nuts trying to find. A couple years later I wanted to watch it and my family said they had no idea what I was talking about. 

I searched soooo many archived pages, message boards, Reddit, Wikipedia once or twice a year for a few hours until I got discouraged. Yesterday was time for my annual search. There’s only so many pages available that could possibly list Japanese children’s films with a blue rabbit wearing a waistcoat. I went through countless  pages of every anime that was released in America and nothing even close. Finally found a random anime page that had a list of rabbits (and I swear I thought I checked them all) and on page 17 of 18 I found it. I literally screamed and scared by boyfriend. 

It was The Legend of Manxmouse. I found a dubbed version online and found it again on YouTube and I was ready to cry. Not only did I find it I can watch it again. My boyfriend understands how excited I am because I’ve roped him into the search before and he offered to take me out to dinner to celebrate. That’s how big this was. My family gaslit me growing up constantly and maybe insisting on finding this after being told I’m being crazy and should drop things so many other times is what pushed me. Also I’m fucking great at googling things and always find what I’m looking for so not finding a trace of this was baffling. 

I just needed to share how crazy excited and relieved I feel and want to know if anyone else has been on a crazy long search for something that eventually did pay off.

Edit: yes I know what gaslighting is, and no I don’t think they really gaslighted me about this particular thing (maybe) but possibly as a coping mechanism to the crap I was put through growing up I held on to this one dumb thing.",0
People Apologize to Statues,"A few years ago, I ate at a Thai restaurant that was fairly small and busy. As you walk in the front door, on one side is the hostess station where you ask to be seated and on the other is a statue of Buddha. This is not a realistic statue, mind; it’s about four feet tall and gold gilt wood. Not the fat, jolly Buddha but the seated meditating Buddha with the pointed flame above its head. The space between the hostess station and the Buddha is only about three and a half to four feet. 

As I was sitting there waiting for my food, I saw someone take a step backward when the hostess came up to the station and sense that they were invading the statue’s personal space and quickly turn and apologize to it. The first time was amusing, but in the hour I sat there I saw about five people total apologize to that statue for getting into its personal space. Most of them quickly looked around, hoping no one saw them apologize to a statue, but a couple of them weren’t even aware they had done so. 

It was kind of fascinating. Has anyone else seen something like this happen?",0
"Whenever I dream that I'm flying, I can't fly more than a few feet off the ground","I had dreams tonight that I could fly. And it was fun, but even so I realized that whenever I dream about flying, I cannot get higher than maybe 30ft off the ground. Even in the dreams I realized this, so I climbed on the roof of my house and tried to fly 30ft higher there. 

I absolutely love dreams where I'm flying, but I really wish that I could find a way to fly higher.",0
Sleepovers are still fun when you aren't a child/teenager anymore. Also hugging your friends is great,"I'm almost 24, I still have sleepovers with my friends. Sometimes because it's fun, sometimes because it's convenient. Every sleepover we've had was so much fun. When we graduated high school, I was kinda afraid the sleepovers would stop, but I'm so glad they didn't.

I've a friendgroup of 14, mostly guys. When arriving and especially when leaving, we all hug each other.

I just have so much love for these people and I feel so blessed to have them in my life. I absolutely love them.",0
I'm visiting family in Texas and have learned some things.,"1) Don't ever ask a Texan to turn their ceiling fan off. Besides the indignant look they give you, they probably don't know how to turn it off. 

2) Keep your grass very short to keep mosquitoes away. 

3) Raccoons down here are the orcas of land animals - they kill for fun, especially chickens. 

It's been a very educational trip.",0

Come Trade Songs With Me! 31/M/US,"I'm home alone a lot, so I often find myself listen to music. Music is special to me in a lot of ways. It's hard to explain but it's easier for me to feel and or understand my emotions more clearly through music. There is seriously something for any type of mood. I have thousands and thousands of songs saved and I'm constantly making playlist. Would any of you be down to maybe add some of yours to my library? I'm constantly looking for music that I have not heard before. That moment you find something that clicks for you after searching for hours and hours through garbage lol. The joy you get from listening to ""that one"" song for the first time and then putting it on repeat for a while. Shoot me a message if you're interested!",0

When i confronted him about why he would serve customers with such a dish, he gave me the spoon and said: ""Try it for yourself"". Still skeptic at his confidence and a little curious, i gave it a taste, and the dish tasted phenomenally DELICIOUS. He elaborated that this is his new recipe and the soda works well as substitute for sugar. Does this ""method"" really exist, and is there anyone out there actually doing this lol?

I love children so much I can’t even tell yall…,"I simply can’t get over how beautiful they are. Pure emotions, no hate towards anything. They are the little explorers of our world. 

I’m 19 years old and had a sister. Sadly she passed away 5 years ago… I miss her every day, but every time I ser a child I remember her and how much I love her. 

And also this makes me think about how much I love childer in general. 

As I mentioned before, the pureness they have is just incredibel. They draw funny figures because they want to. They dont care about a drawn cat not looking like a cat. They just say it is a cat and thats is. How awesome is that. 

I love how direct they are. No gibberish… If they want water for example, they ask for it.

I love how passionate they are. Just randomly decides that hmmm I wanna run down this road. And not even a moment later they start running. They don’t care about nothing else but running down the street. 

Kids are fucking awesome and yall can’t change my mind on that. 

Thanks for reading, have a beautiful day! :)",0

I went down a bit of a rabbit hole reading about sign language and it made me realize how badly I'd misunderstood it all these years.,"I was never really taught anything about sign language. I mean, I've been aware of it as a concept for as long as I can remember, but it was never really talked about beyond the basic 'this is how deaf people communicate' explanation that I'd imagine most kids get the first time they're exposed to the idea. I never knew anyone who signed, much less anyone who signed as their primary language. It was never offered as an elective language course in high school or university either, as far as I was aware. 

Looking back, I realize that I've always subconsciously thought of sign language as a way to communicate non-verbally in English. Language requires words and words require sound, right? So these signs must be representations of sounds, and since they call it American Sign Language, they must be representations of English words.

[Well as it turns out...](https://media.giphy.com/media/ceeN6U57leAhi/giphy.gif)

Sign language isn't a non-verbal representation of English, it's a full-blown language of its own! Signs aren't representations of words, they're representations of *concepts* in just the same way that words are!

Maybe I'm outing myself as a dummy here, but I feel like most hearing people don't fully grasp that. I never would have thought, for example, that puns in sign language would stem from a similarity in signs rather than a similarity in the sounds of those English words. The idea that people could have regional accents in sign language wouldn't have occurred to me in a million years. I had always kind of thought of sign language as somehow being a different thing from ""real"" languages, and I'm only just beginning to realize how wrong I was.

Inflation made the 4th quiet in my neighborhood.,"I live in a small rural town, in central Wisconsin, and normally, days before and days after the 4th, every night you would hear people shooting off their fireworks. Not this year. The price of everything else and the rising cost of fireworks have taken their toll. It's been eerily quiet this entire week.

Why did you choose your university major?,"My major is biology, there are no jobs but I'm not really smart but I've been very fond of animals and nature since my childhood 🤣

I had a microscope in my childhood and I have one now too...I had chickens, ducks, cats, and a parrot and nothing else would get me out of my house except to go to a place where there were animals.

This is still one of the options I feel most happy to choose even though there are no good jobs،I think that some chose their specialties for reasons other than passion, such as the availability of good jobs, money, or family advice",0
A scammer thinks they got got me. What should I do to mess with them?,"So I listed a desk for sale on Facebook marketplace and a fake profile replied that they wanted to buy the desk and that they will send FedEx to come pick it up.

It immediately felt strange since not only was the profile fake, but they were based in a different country (judging by the people liking and commenting on the fake profile's photos which advertised dominatrix services), and the FedEx charges would be much higher than the price of the desk itself. At this point I was like 75% sure this was a scam.

I accepted their offer and they told me that I would need to pay for insurance with FedEx but that it's okay since she will add the insurance costs on top of the price of the desk when they pay me. At this point I was 99.99% this was a scam. I received an email from ""FedEx"" with request for payment for the insurance, but the email address ends in [gmail.com](https://gmail.com), so now I'm 100% sure this is a scam.

I tried reporting the scammer to Facebook, but they didn't find anything wrong and will not delete the user. I can't find where to report this scammer, so maybe I should just f\*ck with them? They sending question marks to me on Messenger since I haven't sent the insurance money yet.

The third book is killing me,"I'm reading the Earth's Children book series and found that it had a total of six books. The first book for so good for me that I bought the next five immediately after I was done. I was home with covid so breezed right through the second book then this third book came along, The Mammoth Hunter. 722 pages from page 200 to where I'm at around 500 it reads like a bad soap opera. I can't go on

Ayla ""A woman of the clan never refuses any order from a man.""
Jondalar ""Ayla, you're so honest and straight forward.""
Renac ""Ayla do this.""
Ayla *doesn't refuse*
Jondalar *shocked Pikachu*

It gets so bad where one person is literally saying something point blank to the other and the next line is them completely ignoring that and going off the deepened. This book makes we want to tear out the pages and set them on fire after each one. I'm too invested now to abandon it forever but I think it needs to spend 6-8 months on the bookshelf to think about what it's done.

What series are you guys reading with books that made your rage?",0

How do British people have such eloquent vocabulary?,"EEvery native British person I have met seems to have an extensive vocabulary. My first language is English. My grammar isn't the greatest and I grew up in an English speaking country, but our speech isn't quite the same. Any thoughts on it? How does one learn such specific and obsecure vocabulary?I was watching QI and there were crazy words that I have never heard before, like spoonerisms. (I always thought they were called Bush-isms lolCanada, an doesn't have that pizazz like the British do If anything, it sounds the same as Americans. I've noticed this with folks from all sorts of education (or little education) levels. It's not just the accent; the words that come out make everything sound so much more refined.",0

I'm searching for similar contents on YouTube. but don't find anything. can someone please give me recommendations?,"I saw a lot of videos of Valspire Family Channel recently and really want to see more content similar, but Idk how to search and didn't find nothing with YouTube recommendations.

Upset over a drama :(,"I started watching this period drama about a Chinese Empress' rise to power through heart-wrenching hardships. There's this crown prince who falls for her way early in the show, but he is deposed off soon after his coronation, and they have to part ways. This is where everything starts going downhill (atleast momentarily).

Now, most of it is not based on facts, and I'm not even upset about their fate, but the fact that she could meet the one person who she truly loved and was never afraid to bare her emotions infront of him, and they made such a terrific couple, but never once in the show could they get together, and she eventually marries another King to exact revenge blah blah. I wish the show makers had at least gotten the crown prince another love interest after she got married 😔

Why it makes me so upset is because there do exist people like them, who can never be with the people they love, till the very end. If it's so heartbreaking just watching them, I can only imagine what kind of torment it actually is for the people involved.

Here's to hoping there's more place for love in this world, than hunger of power and greed! 

Have a good day 🍀",0
Anyone else got this type of friend?,"

The friendship where you are so close with this person but you can get months or even years without any contact with them like you both live your separate lives most likely due to you both being busy. Then one of you contacts the other and chats and you chat as if you had just hung out yesterday like you hadn’t spoken in a long time. Tbh those are some of my favorite types of friends it’s me and my best friend in a nutshell and it shows that you can depend on and trust that person because even with no contact for a while they still love ya and will always have your back and I think that’s sweet.",0

Fourth of July Story,"My family loves the Fourth of July. Every year we go to my grandmother’s house (even when we lived 300 miles away!) which has a huge communal backyard, and shoot of dozens of fireworks. We joke that my dad turns into a twelve-year-old boy.

For years we had a mostly unspoken competition going with my grandma’s neighbors, which we always won (they acknowledged it on Facebook and even thanked us for the show). I’ve recently stopped lighting fireworks myself and spent more time watching the ones we light off.

Last year, fireworks were insanely expensive and, although we spent the same indulgent amount of money we usually spend on them, couldn’t get nearly enough. It was clear that night that the neighbors had won, the student had finally become the master. There was a beautiful moment where, for the first time I can remember, all five of us came together, lined up our biggest fireworks, and lit them off for the grand finale. It was an emotional passing the torch moment.

This year, we’ve toned it down a little. Thanks to my dad and aunt coming together, we were able to get a fair amount of fireworks - they’re still very expensive - but it’s still very light for us. We got a dog last year, and my mom spent most of the night with her in the basement, calming her down. I volunteered to do so this year. While I’m sad to miss quite a few of the fireworks, we eventually went from the guest bedroom, my dog’s first choice of shelter, to the basement, where there is a little window through which I can partially see the fireworks and can fully see my family lighting them and running. I have the Revolution episode of America: The Story of Us playing in the background, and my dog has relaxed a little bit.

&#x200B;

I’m a very patriotic person. This isn’t coming from a hillbilly or anything, but I do love America. My family has been here for generations, from Ireland and Germany, mostly. I feel like whenever I say, “I love America,” I get attacked because of all the problems in this country. The injustices both past and present. But revisiting this history documentary I’ve seen so many times with people I love, I have a hard time *not* loving this country. We have an incredible story that everyone is a part of, even if you weren’t born here. We’re a melting pot, with all sorts of ingredients and spices that make the perfect recipe for Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. I’m not naive or blind to what’s going on, and I think that just strengthens my patriotism. I love this country, its story, and its people, even if I disagree with them. When I watch the documentaries and read the stories, I think, “*I have a connection with these people.“* They’re not my family or ancestors. But they’re my countrymen. 

A lot of people think my stance is cheesy, foolish, and overly optimistic. Maybe it is. But that’s also what a lot of people in 1776 thought, too.",0
I have a guardian angel that I didn't know about,"So I just found out that someone has been looking out for me for the past couple of years without me knowing.

I have a habit of walking around very late at night, it's just something that helps me clear my mind. And I just found out that someone had been making sure I was alright during that time without interfering with my way of life.

They'd just keep keep an eye out incase something happened (which thankfully nothing did happen) but after finding out that all these years there was someone always there while I was zoned out, minding my business not thinking anyone was bothered by me, I am oddly comforted by this knowledge.

But this also made me realize I have absolutely zero idea of who's watching me and when and that's slightly unsettling. Although in this case it's wholesome but I can't help but wonder in other situations you know.

Idk how to feel I do be having mixed emotions.",0
"Someone came up to me today and said “if you see (my name), tell her I said hi”.

He was a complete stranger, I’ve never seen him before. He was like “she’s been telling me about this place, do you know her? Tell her I said hi” and he didn’t tell me his name. 

I’ve never told anyone about that place… I’ve never talked to him

Why do I spend so much of my day thinking about other people?,In a way focusing on others is good but I notice I’m too observant about everything in people and they act funny or weirded out when I focus too much on the details of the conversations we had or about unnecessary things..

"When you’re sick, do you get “the sick smell”?","For clarification, every time I’m sick with something respiratory-related, I get this smell in my nose that only comes around when I’m sick. I’m not sure if it’s the smell of bacteria or mucus or what it is, but if I get the smell I know I am 100% sick. 

It’s handy, as I know I am probably infectious once I get the smell so I can stay inside, away from others. It kind of smells like chemicals, but it’s not generally very strong. In addition, it comes with a sort of tenderness in my nasal passages. 

Anybody else get the sick smell?",0

How did you guys make friends in your post college life?,"I’m about a year out from college & I have a pretty good job with a nice apartment. I like my job too but my coworkers feel more like coworkers than anything. I have hobbies but I find them to be very individualistic by nature (reading, drawing, writing, running, hitting the gym). 

I guess it just feels like I barely know anyone in my city. Life’s not bad but I just feel a bit stagnate. I will say also my city is a bit notorious amongst young people for having “nothing to do” even though it’s a really big city.

Maybe the reason the youngest siblings are spoiled/treated better is because the parents make more money than they did in the oldest’s youth,"They also could be nicer/less stressed because they don’t have money issues. I see a lot of people act like the oldest kids are hardened/low maintenance, the middle kids are a bit spoiled, and the youngest are completely spoiled brats. I’ve seen a lot of posts throughout my social media acting like the favorite is always the youngest. I’m just posing a reason why it’s perceived that way. I’m older than my only sibling by 5 years and I never felt like either of us got special treatment (just so I don’t get called biased fyi). Also maybe the younger kid doesn’t understand the financial situation the family is in and the parent(s) might indulge them instead of telling the truth",0
I like watching youtube videos of old abandoned cars starting up. And old airplanes.,"A few years ago I discovered videos on youtube featuring old propeller airplanes starting up and flying. And videos about old 1910s race cars, like those featured on Jay Leno's Garage.  Cars with airplane engines and steam engines especially fascinate me.  So I'll check those out sometimes when idling away time on youtube.  (At least, I'm assuming other people do this.)

In recent months I started watching car videos I hadn't seen before. Old abandoned cars getting pulled out of the weeds and started, after sitting and rusting for decades.  The hosts, two average guys who possess amazing sets of skills, get to work.  They clean off the engine, check everything over, and do whatever they have to do to get it started and running.  Then they drive it out of the weeds.  It's like a resurrection, only with a car.  It's amazing.  

[Right now I'm watching this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_-YgAa7Yn4).  The car's already in the garage in this one.  

It's satisfying, to coin a phrase, to watch the car finally start and run.  The leadup is suspenseful.  Will it start?  Will it?

Anyhow, these videos remind me of the kinds that used to be on PBS, like This Old House, but with old cars.

Does anyone else share this fascination?  I can't be the only one.",0

Hit someone’s car today,"It’s 4th of July and I was on my way from the store. I was super excited for later today because I planned for some friends over. On the way back, the road I usually take to my house was closed off, so I took the next road. It was backed up with a line of golf carts and I panicked as there were cars on either side of me parked on the sides of the street and a golf cart was literally heading my way. I started to back up and in my panic hit a woman’s car. She was literally in the car and yelled at me. I had no idea what to do and broke down into tears. There were people staring at me from all directions. Can’t wait to tell my parents later!!!

Anyways! How was your 4th of July? Hopefully better than mine :)",0
"My neighbor came over today to confess that he accidentally flew a drone into my roof, putting a hole in it","This happened around 7 pm yesterday while my family and I were at a friend's house playing board games. We didn't even notice the hole in the roof until he pointed it out to us. He was apologizing profusely and assured us that he would be having a roofing contractor come over as soon as possible this week to look at and fix it.

He was shocked that my wife and I were 'so cool about the situation'. We were equally shocked that he owned up to the situation, since the hole was in a part of the roof that might have taken us weeks to find and, not knowing how it happened, we would have just eaten the cost ourselves to have someone come out and fix it.",0
Working fast food,"Recently started working fast food again (age 24). Before, I never really saw myself working in the industry again just because I knew other jobs would pay more. Now that I've been here a few months, I can say that I really enjoy the job. There are some days where things don't run as smoothly, but all in all it's one of my favorite jobs I've worked before, and I've worked at around 20 different jobs. Before I had difficulty keeping jobs and you could say my work ethic was poor. Being lazy was never the issue though. It was just me being hard-headed and giving up positions due to small reasons, or simply getting fired for not being able to meet the companies attendance goals. Where I work now, it's not 'hard' labor. As in I don't have to lift heavy stuff very often, it's not physically exhausting, and it's actually really enjoyable. I can say this is one of the only jobs where I feel like I could never mess up my attendance. When there's a situation that arises that stresses me out, it's rather simple to handle with the management and so far it's been very reasonable. I've had a few customers who weren't the nicest, but overall a lot of the customers are friendly. As far as employees, I've met some cool people that are enjoyable to work with. I consider them my friends, but I wouldn't want to mislabel anything, since sometimes the people you work with are rather your acquaintance(s)., I'd suggest that if anyone is looking for a job but doesn't want to do fast food, if you're struggling to find work, at least give it a try. Trial and error is normal and you never know when you could find a job that you enjoy. 

Tldr: started working fast food recently and really enjoy it. I'd suggest if anyone is looking for work, don't overlook fastfood as an option.",0

"POV- You are living alone in a city, miles away from your Home","Mom – Did you have your dinner?
Me – Yeah, I am eating, it’s good. (While chewing burned roti)

Working on your career, while working on your relationships, while working on your physical health, while working on your personal goals, while unlearning wrong mindsets you picked up and while staying positive in life… Oh boy, you are on fire! Even after being so busy, in the middle of a party, out of nowhere you are missing your home, family and all those little things you were once bored of. 

You are sick and you don't see a glass of hot milk with medicines at your bed table but you have got to wake up and switch on that laptop and start typing. No one is there to make you your favourite breakfast, so you have to boil eggs and oats. You are watching friends while eating and you think, “Well, life is not that bad”. But wait, you have a huge bag of laundry to do and an apartment to clean. Your exams are also coming. But wait, first go and complete your presentation!

 “But I am sick, I need to take rest. Please!”
“Sorry boy, but you'll have to finish your part of work. We all are dealing with the same problems.”

Problems that didn't look like problems when surrounded by loved ones. I miss it. Mom's pakoras on a rainy day, Dad bringing my favourite fruit, annoying my sister and all our shared laughter. I miss the talks and jokes. I miss everything.
But I'm here and they are far. You can't expect anyone to love and care for you the way a family does. 

That's how my days have been going. How about yours?

I did ask my husband to get a cake, but it was like 8pm and only because I realized no one had any plans even though they promised (my parents and siblings). For weeks before they promised they'd plan something. My mom's birthday is 4 days before mine and I got cake and a whole basket of stuff for her. Money was tight and I pretty much spent the money that could have been a nice gift from my husband/kids on her birthday. This has been a reoccurring thing with my family.

How to change an introverted pre-teen (due to pandemic) to turn back to normal?,"So last December I went back home for good after years of working overseas. I have a younger brother who is now 14 years old and I was surprised that he is not the same as he used to be. My last vacation was in 2019 and at that time he was so very energetic, very talkative, and likes to play. He is 10 years old at that time. Now, he is so introverted, doesn't talk as much, is always on social media (TikTok), always moody when we go outside with our parents especially when there is an occasion, you name it. Also, his eyesight now is very bad because of his phone addiction. He changed a lot during the pandemic and I clearly understand why it happened.

 Last week I tried to wake him up early morning for a long walk to engage him in activities but lasted only for 2 days straight. Now, I am planning to do it again. I'm afraid that if he will not change he might regret it later in his adult life. I am now 32 years old and we have an age gap as siblings. Our parents are a bit old too. Any suggestions or tips?

"Is it just me, or are Gumi Bears lowkey a great setting for an exploration-based open-world puzzle adventure video game?","I have been sorting through some old stuff and stumbled upon some Gummi Bears cassettes. These are not official media, mind, but home recordings of TV broadcasts, incomplete, disjointed, interspersed with various other stuff, but I still remember watching them over and over as a kid.

Then the sudden realization struck me: the creators of the cartoon, by complete accident, created a great setting for an open-world video game. All these secret tunnels, caches, even cities, left behind by old civilisation, full of technological and magical artifacts, being explored and rediscovered by the protagonists and coveted by their enemies, all surrounded by a beautiful natural scenery. There even is a freaking fast-travel system! It's almost uncanny.

Update: I drank my first drink!,"[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/vnitkc/18m_first_time_drinking/) 

I did it.

When the class organised a outing I went for it and they brought beer & Soju. I had a sip of soju initially but the taste was disgusting so I refrained from the drinking games and such then a friend dared me to take a shot near the end so I did. Tasted horrible and 30 mins later I am not impaired but I have a slight headache and I have school tomorrow so I'll be drinking lots of water before bed. Unfortunately I didn't get to taste the beer because my friends are fast drinkers lol. Nearly everyone had extensive experience with alcohol lol. Had lots of fun at the beach at night. 

Verdict: probably won't drink again except probably in celebration after finishing my A Levels

We Bought Half a Pig From the Butcher,"So, yeah.  Hubby and I went halfsies with our friend and we got a pig directly from the butcher to save money.  We got ham, bacon, and pork chops.  The thing is, it's really gross!  I grew up getting meat from the supermarket and have never tried chicken, pigs, or cows ""from the farm.""  Mom talked about being on her cousins' farm while animals were being slaughtered and butchered when she was growing up, but I never thought to ask her if she ate them (I'm assuming she did) or what she thought of it.  It's just too strong for me.  We had ham one night and it tasted okay (better than it smelled), but when I took the lid off the crock pot the next day, the smell nearly knocked me over and we threw it away.  I just made bacon this morning and it smelled SO bad while it was cooking.  I ate it on a BLT, so I don't know how it tastes on its own, I was too grossed out to try a slice by itself.  I don't even want to try the pork chops.

Does anyone here get their meat from the source?  What do you think?  I'm going to stick to getting it from stores from now on.

Now I hear this a lot, and I'm often skeptical about these coincidences and regard them as only occurring because of a recent search on one of the devices. But in this case, I am sure that neither of us had searched the word ""Air Fryer"" on either of our devices. We had only TALKED about it.

Can someone please tell me if this was a coincidence or planned?

Edit: I'm not implying that Amazon or any other company records/listens to our daily conversations. I thought there might be a technical/psychological explanation for it. For instance, the fact that we pay more attention to what is in front of us; I speak about buying lots of things during the day and I don't see all of them showing up on my phone. But when only one case does, it makes all the difference in the world in my mind. Any thoughts?",0
I Keep day dreaming about Ramen.,"I recently had Ramen for the first time, and I feel like I've gone through a life changing experience. 

I'm really happy to have discovered this amazing dish buts it's made me a little sad that I have only just now found it. Like how many times could I have ended the ""sesh"" with a bowl of spicy Ramen??? How many times have I scanned past Ramen on the menu only to pick something that didn't quite hit the spot. Why didn't my friends tell me about this? Why don't they offer the opportunity to be paid in Ramen instead of money? I'm actually considering dressing up as something Ramen related the next time a legitimate opportunity to fancy dress comes up. 

I keep having this recuring day dream of meeting a random stranger who after long rambling conversation reveals that they make Ramen or know the best Ramen spot in town. We would then indulge in some of the devils lettuce as a starter before procceding to demolish large bowls of Ramen. 

This scenario plays out at least 10 times a day in my mind.

Does anyone else like this dish? What is your favourite type? Does anyone know of any good spots in London/UK? 

TLDR:  I have discovered I love Ramen in my late 30s.",0
"I went to a Stadlfest (party on the countryside) for the first time, and i hated it.","I live in Vienna, Austria and I'm currently doing a cooking internship on the countryside, so a couple days ago another intern asked me to go to the Stadlfest with her, I was really excited because I had never been to one and I really liked the other her. 

But I really just can't understand how it's fun for anyone. Everything is ear numbingly loud and it's so crowded, that to walk 30 feet you need 10 minutes. Also as soon as I showed up all of my friends were already completely buzzed so I couldn't talk to them even if the terrible music was any quieter. I know everyone has a different taste, but I really struggle to see the appeal. What do you think about these sorts of places?

I'm sorry for the rant and if my English is a little crooked, I'ts not my first language.",0

Some film / TV series should have ended a lot sooner.,"I feel like some films and TV shows shouldn’t still be going or kept on for as long as they did as it kind of just turns into a cash cow that decreases in quality as it goes on.

Take the Star Wars series. It should have ended with RotS. We had the main story, then the ‘what happened before the main story’ and that’s all we needed. The MCU definitely should’ve ended with Endgame. I know the ‘Avengers’ did but my god they are just squeezing out as much as possible with superhero films these days. 

A good example is Harry Potter. Yes they’ve put out Fantastic Beasts but even though it’s based within that world it’s a book so I get it and it’s not directly based on the original series.

An example of over run TV shows are The Office, which should’ve ended after Season 7. The Simpsons and Family Guy for obvious reasons.

I’m posting this here instead of an actual r/movies sub as I want the opinion of a casual viewer and not just die hard fans of the series’ mentioned above.",0
Two years in therapy,"I completed two years in therapy and I can't even believe that. But I've reached a point where I hate my self awareness (idk if someone else feels like it). It's only because, now I know what I want, my gut voice has developed, I'm filtering out people who are not nice/kind to me, I know what I want relationship wise so if a guy is not sharing that same dynamic- I politely leave, I've also become assertive. So yeah, sometimes I miss the old me- the one who felt numb because now, I've allowed myself to feel all kinds of emotions (something I wasn't allowed to as a kid). It's just hard, people make it look like that healing is a beautiful journey on Instagram, people who are actually doing the work realise how fucking painful, overwhelming, and exhausting it is. I know it will get better but I just have all this anger that nobody talks about this or prepares us for it, that it does feel fucking lonely at times. My therapist also pointed out that, I feel lonely because I don't allow myself to express in the way that I want to- that I label myself as 'too much', that gave a lot of clarity 🥲",0

For the first time I got a good feeling about being in a relationship,"So, a while back (a month and a half) I met this girl on tinder, we started chatting, I thought she was super funny and the conversation ran along naturally, which I liked a lot. We met a up a week later and I felt something good there! So anyways, we continue talking and meeting up basically once a week, and right now, a month and a half later, I'm really crazy about her, and I'm pretty sure she feels the same about me, which is great!

Thing is, I've only dated two other people, and one relationship was worst than the other. Both started out pretty strong but as time passed it got worse and worse, and by the end both just really sucked. (I don't blame either one of them, also. In the end it just didn't work out) After the second one ended I took some time to myself, got really worried thinking I was the problem. I'm all better now, but it still sucked. 

But I don't know, with this girl, I feel really good. Like, it feels simple and easy. I think it's supposed to feel like this? I'm not really sure. But I sure am enjoying the hell out of it. I'm thinking about asking her to be, like, ""officially"" my gf in the next week or two, so hopefully that works out well! Really excited to finally being happy for once.

A weird memory from elementary school,"My friend told me about a planetary alignment last month, and that got me thinking about a memory I have of of a school assembly 40ish years ago where one of the teachers tearfully told us that due a planetary alignment the world was going to end.

I thought, how could I remember such a weird thing and why would we be told this?

"Planning to give myself a spa day few times a month. Never did it, feels a bit strange to relax…","Hello everyone,

I (28m) am working since 4 years in another country where you can find a lot of spa and pool areas. Since 4 years I didn’t took a vacation, learned a new language to professional level, changed a jobs and always worked my heart out. 

I decided to change a few things this year (more sport/gym because I got fat during corona, find a new friends and leave more time for my self). I just started with the gym and made it consistent habit, next point is to take some time and relax. Only thing is that I’m a bit uncomfortable to visit pool/spa/sauna place alone - I dunno what can I do and I don’t know how to relax.

Do you have any suggestions? What do you do at places like that? I feel pressure that I always need to talk with someone and it’s hard to leave a thoughts to just chill in my head.

And I wanted to give myself some few days vacation in Austrian mountains/lakes in some fancy hotel - but again the same problem - what to do there all alone?

I will just try it eventually, hope it ends well :)",0
Anyone remember angsty teen web journals from the late 90s?,"Back in 1998 and 1999, I was really into reading online journals. This was before weblogs really blew up and went mainstream; it seemed to be mostly a pursuit for nerdy teenagers—usually girls— who wanted to play with HTML and needed an outlet to vent about, well, being a nerdy teenager. For my part, I was an awkward guy who was interested in girls, so reading about their lives online was very compelling.

I had my own little journal for a while, but I don't think anyone else ever read it...which is probably for the best.

At this point, I'm pushing 40 years old but it's amazing to read stuff I wrote \~22 years ago and still being about to see elements of the same person.

I can still remember a lot of the sites; I used to read they all had great names like ""torn"" and ""made to be broken""—my own little journal went through a bajillion cringe-y names, like ""daydreams"", ""debris"", and ""rinse"". I remember a few domains, like [plastique.org](https://plastique.org) which hosted a number of interesting journals if I recall correctly.

I wish I had more patience,"I started a job recently and the set-up of it is perfect for the hours I'll be doing for school, as well as being able to help out my family. I enjoy the job, and while I'm in no way perfect, I've done similar work for a /long/ time, so I'm halfway decent at it.

The only literal downside is that I work with people who are LOUD (and one who makes decisions without communicating). It's an evening job, quiet shifts normally, but they watch TV loud, or talk on the phone with the person on the other end on speaker, and just my own pet peeve smack on gum.

I've found a way to remove myself, but I know how it looks.

Anyone else prefer to eat one very large meal a day?,"I used to eat 6 meals a day (snacks and meals), then slowly I cut back to 3 large meals a day. I heard from someone that intermittent fasting can provide health benefits (I'm not a doctor so please don't quote me on this). However, I thought I'd give it a try, and I've since been usually eating just 1 very large meal a day (roughly 2000 calories in one sitting, no snacking or other meals). I find that I have more time throughout the day now, and I also find that I feel a lot more satisfied with what I am eating this way. I can eat my healthy stuff and then I can have a few deserts at the end too. It just feels like I'm eating way more than 2000 calories this way, whereas sometimes I felt myself craving more when I would eat 700 calories 3 times a day type of thing.

How do you feel when your friend does TikTok live to connect with TikTok friends and ignores you most of the time?,"What do you think of a friend who does this TikTok live thingy while you're travelling on a trip together in his car?

"I hate assigned seating in movie theaters, if you want a good seat get there early","I haven’t been to a movie theater I don’t think since 2019, but I remember the last time I went assigned seating was a thing and it was so silly because it was a tiny hard to read map of the theater and all it did was hold up the line with people thinking about their decision. Just get there early it’s not that hard if you have a specific seat you like. 

I’m going to try another movie theater that happens to be closer to me. I hope most theaters aren’t still doing this nonsense!

I might also add sometimes you don’t know what seat you prefer unless you’re familiar with the theater you’re entering. Center seats offer the best view, but seats off to the side also have the advantage of a little more privacy and you tend to be situated around less people, also easier to get in and out.",0

I work 7 days a week,"I'm so proud of myself because I've been going through depression for more than 5 years at the moment. I was afraid before because my life is already hard to just hold myself together everyday, but I challenged myself to give it a shot and it turned out pretty good.

So I'm doing 3 part time jobs during this summer vacation. First one is working at private institution for elementary school students and I've been loving these kids lately. And all of the bosses and teachers are being super nice to me. Second one is private tutoring and I found that teaching is kind of my thing. I've never officially taught someone before but I think I'm loving it. The last one is a guard at Balenciaga store which entails dealing with customers especially controlling them when all the workers are serving. Even though it is kind of boring and tedious, all of the workers are being super kind to me.

This is a big progress for me. I think I'm growing everyday in terms of social skills since that is what I really lack of. And I learned to be more grateful for everything. I also learned how to cherish my childhood by interacting with kids. Even though it's exhausting and consuming my energy a lot, I think I made a right choice and I'm sure I would become more mature by the end of the summer.",0

So, I gave myself the challenge to put them aside for 30 days and have been trying other things like learning bass and have been practising every time I feel the urge to play a video game.

What is the spookiest time of day?,"  This is a purely subjective question. It could be argued that midnight is the spookiest time because it is the furthest point from the light of day. It also could be argued that 7:00 P.M. is the spookiest time because it is approximately when the sky darkens (depending on location and time of the year) and a long night remains. Many people will have many ideas about what the spookiest time is and why. Let’s discuss jovially!

  I’ll start. For me personally, the spookiest time is 3:00 A.M. It is a very late time in the deep, dark night. I work for a restaurant and I often drive home from work at around midnight. I’m used to late hours. When 3:00 rolls around, however, I feel like I really should be asleep. 5:00 A.M., although even later and colder than 3:00, is less spooky because it is near sunrise; I perceive it more as being very early morning than very late night. 4:00 is spooky, but it is also somewhat close to sunrise. 3:00 A.M. hits that spooky sweet spot of being very late, dark, and cold, yet still far from sunrise. If I see someone drive by at midnight, I assume it is a normal person having a late night. If I see someone drive by at 5:00 A.M., I think they may be an early riser who slept earlier. If I see someone drive by at 3:00 A.M., I wonder what the hell is going on. Is it someone in trouble, or stirring up trouble?",0
What do you do to cheer your friends up when they're down?,"I've used this ""trick"" on a few people and it's always worked! I compile a list of 10 things I love about them or things that I think make them awesome.

The list has to be personal and intimate; not some random, generic bs. It takes 5 minutes to come up with the list but the reaction I get is profound. I recommend using this hack only once per person otherwise the diamond loses its shine.

College life as a fresher,"It's been about 2 months since I moved to my college hostel for the first time and man do I feel like just writing something about it. Obviously there have been a lot of changes, environmentally and personally.

I'm fortunate enough to have gotten a college of my choosing, we get good food in the mess and the environment of the college is really nice. I like the people here, the seniors are kind and the professors are cool(for the most part). 

The me from two months ago and the me now are quite different. This is a place I feel comfortable in and I've been able to become more confident. I've made more friends and acquaintances here than I've made in the last 3 years! This part of my experience has definitely been the most difficult for me and I'm still somewhat struggling with it but many of these friendships were things I had to actively initiate myself and feel proud of myself for taking that initiative. I've also become fitter than before by joining the gym, so that's nice. I know I seem like I'm bragging, but I'm really not!

Ofcourse, there are times when I'm dissatisfied, and that's commonly when I think I could have done better in a social interaction or yearned more from it. 

And ofcourse I think about getting into a relationship but even if a girl interests me, after talking to them for a while, I convince myself that this isn't a relationship that would work out( but a friendship would be quite nice). I am friends with one such person but yet I can't keep myself from wanting to spend more time with them and that kind of annoys me.

Then there's the main thing I came here to do: academics! I've mostly liked the courses we've had so far and am able to cope with it to a decent degree. I do procrastinate a lot (I should be writing my lab report instead of this post) and I really really want to spend time practicing on my bass guitar, which I haven't done for a week now! 

Well, I think that's all of it. It's been a good experience for the most part. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this post. How have your college lives been? Have anyone of you newly moved to college like me?",0
Enjoy Streaming on Twitch and Making Youtube Content but I get burned out doing both,"Alt account

&#x200B;

Been streaming for years and I love video editing for years. And lately I figured, ""making content on youtube would be a good way to keep me busy video editing and share my thoughts and ideas"" Sure I doubt anyone would watch them, but felt more therapeutic than posting my thoughts on r /truegaming or something.

But by wanting to make weekly Youtube Content, I started getting burned out streaming too. ('cause also juggling with real full time job). 

Part of me just wants to stop this whole Weekly Youtube thing and just focus on streaming, but I also want to share my thoughts on all these indie games I've been playing, that streaming just doesn't do it justice for how great and how I feel for some of these games I've played.

&#x200B;

idk. I guess I just don't know how to stream on twitch, make content on youtube all while having a full time job. Not like I'm some big twitch stream. just some small nobody. But making content just makes me happy.",0
"(Dark) Black People, and People of Colour, What do You Look for in Makeup?","I really want to make an incredibly inclusive makeup brand that is reasonably priced. What inspired me was the fact that people with dark skin tones couldn't find good makeup for them that would match their skin. The beauty industry is an incredibly racist industry, which sucks. Though, as a pale, white person, I've never known to struggle to find my shade. What I've heard from black beauty content creators is that lot of the time it was too light or too red. So besides that, what is something you enjoy in makeup? 

&#x200B;

Please let me know so I can create a black-friendly and inclusive makeup brand someday! Besides that, I also want my brand to promote intimacy, skin texture, and body positivity. That's a lot of targets and goals to hit, but with work, I am confident in myself to make sure that this brand is successful one day.",0
sometimes I fucking hate the world we live in,"My and my father went running. At some point we stopped by a fountain to drink ( I do noit know if fountain is the correct translation but I think you know what I mean) . Then, we started running again and after 5 minutes my father realized that he left his phone near the fountain. 
A lot of runners  on sunday pass by that fountain then while I was running back I tried to call the phone to see if some good human was there to answer and keep the phone until I get back. 
A girl answered and she was so kind to wait for me and gave my phone back. 
This girl was with another girl and they were around 16 years old. I thanked them and I really wanted to offer them an ice cream or whatever they wanted to drink. At least  a bottle of water. 
At some point I realized that while I was trying to be kind, they were ""scared"" because I kept insisting. As soon as I realized that I of course immediately stop. 
I turned 29 yesterday and I am a male. They were scared because they saw an adult keep trying to offer them something. I have the feeling that they even thought I left the phone on purpose. 
It really hurts and sucks.

Don't you hate it when you fall asleep in the free time window you have after your daily routine?,"So lately I've been falling asleep and waking up at 1am, just little after getting to my home after work pretty much wasting the 7 hours of free time I have where I love to just be in my cozy place drinking some warm coffe and maybe play some games, browse the internet or watch some series before I got to sleep and the next daily routine begins.

And it's not like I can replace those wasted hours by doing that in the early morning because I know that by the time I only have like 1 hour before I have to prep to go to work I'm gonna start feeling sleepy and feel like shit through all the day.",0
A person told me in a respectful manner today that we should probably be better off as friends (we had been chatting daily with the idea of eventually dating). Why can't this level of communication be normal?,"So, as it a bit of background: Someone reached out me from one of my R4R posts, and we had started chatting. Last night, they mentioned to me that they thought we'd be better off as friends, with a clear rationale as to why. 

Why can't this level of communication be normalized? 

The amount of times I've been ghosted while dating casually is pretty frustrating. Even a simple ""hey, I'm just not feeling the vibes here"" is fine with me. 

It's fully okay if you don't see someone as a romantic partner, that's normal. But if you feel that way, you should tell someone rather than ghosting/leading them along.

I kinda hate concerts and I’m a little tired of trying to make myself enjoy them,"Don’t get me wrong, live music isn’t bad. The atmosphere is completely different and often times the performer will put an interesting spin on the song that gives it a different feeling from the studio version. But overall I think the experience is just not for me, mostly because of the other people there. People singing along to the lyrics, being slammed into, smelling people’s BO, etc it’s just not a very fun time and really affects my ability to enjoy the music 

Does anyone else relate? I expressed this in real life once and everyone looked at me like I have three heads. I feel like maybe if shows weren’t so expensive I could justify going to them more. Music isn’t really a social thing for me either so that plays into it a lot I think",0
"Tried to watch Shirley Temple shows, the key word being tried.","For those of you who don't know, Shirley Temple was an actress who starred in numerous shows as a child during the 1930s. She was popular in her day and is one of the earliest Hollywood stars to ever grace America.

Feeling curious, I tried to watch some of her early shows on YouTube, only to feel dirty afterwards. It definitely did not help that the first video I watched was called *War Babies*, an episode about her roleplaying a burlesque dancer and wooing male children roleplaying soldiers in their diapers at what I think is kindergarten age. I also watched some other scenes that did not help alleviate my concerns for her.

I've read before that Hollywood was a much more dangerous place to be back then, but this makes me think that all the negative stereotypes about Hollywood have some truth in them.",0
"I'm a grown-ass adult, just had my first 'proper' driving lesson and feeling great!","Finally getting around to having a car license. I (30s) haven't for a long time because of a mix of reasons, but cars are a necessity in my country.

Well after finally getting my learners, I had my first official lesson with my Dad, as my siblings did as teens. They warned me of some of his foibles (""right, turn left"") but he's become much more defensive as he aged and I'm much more secure and confident than any of us were as teenagers.

I feel really good about how it went. We're being very deliberate. I'm already familiar with road rules (and drivers that don't follow them) as a cyclist, and had 'driven' a farmboy's knockabout car as a teen, but getting to drive humanity's deadliest weapon for myself as a calm and mature adult felt very empowering.

Instead of watercooler talk I put away my laundry or dishes. Instead of using the public bathroom in the office center I got to use my own. Instead of long commutes I saved money on gas and saved about an hour everyday. 

I actually found myself so much more productive. Productive enough where I was promoted. My quality of life was so much better, that it’s upsetting to think that I can do my job just fine remotely. 

I know many people would tell me to look for a remote job, however that’s very rare in my industry.",0
I'm really proud of myself for going to a skateboarding meet-up today :),"I was raised by an overprotective parent who drilled into me the belief that the whole world is out to get me and that all of the fun things I want to do are ""not worth it."" Now that I'm an adult, I find it very difficult to come out of my shell and take risks.

I've always wanted to learn how to skateboard. I had a longboard in high school so I know the fundamentals. But every time I'd go out my overprotective parent would tsk at me and roll their eyes and complain about how senseless and dangerous skateboarding is. Skateboarding is dangerous, yes, but the fun is worth the risk for me.

I haven't skateboarded in like 10 years (and I was never any good) but recently I found a local organization that caters to adult beginners, especially women, who weren't encouraged to skate as youngsters. Because skate parks are intimidating and full of intimidating people, it's meant to be a ""safe space.""

I went for the first time today and wow, it took all my energy just to dig myself out of bed and get on the bus. When I got there, most of the beginners hadn't arrived and it was just these super skilled skatebros throwing tre flips and smith grinds. I was soooo intimidated but I sussed out an area with gentler ramps that the skatebros were not using. One of the most intimidating looking skatebros was this guy with spiky green hair, but he actually turned out to be a volunteer with the org and was SUPER friendly and helpful. I was going up and down ramps by the end of the day!

I know this isn't much but it's a big deal for me. Just the day before I was trying to ollie with no success because every instinct in my body was telling me that I'd fall and break my skull. It was strangely easier to try risky things in a community setting for some reason, and I got a few good ollies in today! :)

There are other things I want to get out of my comfort zone for and I feel cautiously optimistic... Is anyone else here trying new things this summer, perhaps even risky things? Would love to hear your experience, especially from women, who are often discouraged from things like extreme sports!",0

Do you think having celebrities is a healthy thing for society?,"I wonder first, who is your favorite celebrity? What do you think your relationship is? Do you think they like you or care about you?

What bothers me a bit is this idea that celebrities love their fans, and they do in general. They don't like individual fans because they can't know that many people so they're just liking that you like them. That really means nothing, right? Does it mean something to you?

I guess you want to like a celebrity who appreciates the success the fans allow them to have or even create for them, but is that even a healthy dynamic? This is not how you would treat an individual person, it'd be borderline abusive, right? So it's just like this weird relationship where you want them to like you or even know you exist which they don't and they like you because you like them and for no other reason. Why is this a thing?

I get that we enjoy music, shows, movies, sports, but why idolize and make it into more than it is? Do we lose something by not having parasocial relationships with celebrities? I don't get why we can't treat these people like normal folks who are good at stuff the same way you don't kiss a doctor's ass. Or should we be doing that? I don't know.

But if you get the ones that cover your ankles or more, it can be quite a hassle trying to get out of them quickly. 

So, what your favourite?",0

"Can't get a controller to work for Minecraft windows 10 edition, anyone know what might be wrong?","I know it seems like I should ask this on other subs, but I've already posted this question multiple times on multiple Minecraft subs and waited several days for help, and nobody responded on the Minecraft subreddits (they were posted successfully judging by the view statistics)

Can't find any way to contact the devs about it for help eithe, I looked. So anyways, hopefully someone here might know what's happening, or be able to point me in the right direction?

I have an Xbox Elite 2.0 controller. It works fine for Forza Horizon 4, another game I got off the Microsoft store. And the controller worked for the trial version of windows Minecraft, but not the paid version of the game.

My analog stick can navigate the menus, but none of the buttons do anything, and the analog stick does nothing in-game, I can't use it to move or anything.

Checked the game's settings and there doesn't seem to be a switch to enable controller support or choose it over keyboard.

Anyone know what might be wrong?",0

A house guest today mentioned that my dog always looks depressed and I can't quit thinking about it.,"She is a Golden Retriever and that's just her face.

How would a meeting with a real hacker go without any movie hacking scenes references?,"Well any aboveground white hat hacker(Those who u can simply call when you want your anti-virus license renewed )will be a lot like any other techie. 

I do not fall into that category but I have a lot of friends that fit this description. 

They'll tell you exactly who they are and
where they work. If they're old school they'll likely introduce themselves with their handle, most likely something that ends with Noob or Tech…. Henry uses “Cyber security guru”…… weird but… It’s ok. 

They'l often wear standard techie clothes. Dyed hair and tattoos are common. They are likely to be drinking Club-Mate and/or whiskey.

They have great stories, especially when drunk. If they're listening to music it will either be techno or metal.

A government-affiliated grey/black hat, on the other hand. 

Well… well…. Well

will likely tell you they work in ""security"" and
which organization they work for.


They likely won't provide specifics or will claim to work on the defensive side, although some will admit to working in offense.

They will use dorky government language and clothing. They will tell you nothing interesting.

Well it’s safe to officially introduce myself… Hi I’m Nicolas… “I’m Cyber security analyst”

If you ever meet a criminal hacker, you won't know it. 

You wouldn’t be able to tell the difference if your last slice of pastry depended on it. 

I suppose it isn’t nothing like the movies… where the hacker always has a hoodie on.",0

The weirdest day of school,"So a few weeks ago in high school, our school recognized pride month by having a rainbow assortment of popsicles and cupcakes with glittery nonpareils at dismissal time outside. Around like 25 kids probably had cupcakes since there weren’t too many.

The next day, my best friend was in class next to me. A black student was singing a song that had the n word in it a few times (teacher left the classroom) and my friend sang along but accidentally said the n word in front of everyone. She was so in shock that she started coughing and threw up in the trash can. Because I’m sensitive to vomit, I left the classroom. THEN, there were two people throwing up in the hallway and it smelled horrible. I held my breath and walked to the bathroom when I noticed that the vomit on the floor was full of the nonpareils. It seemed that they weren’t actually edible and were bought from like an arts and crafts store or something, causing people to throw up (or it could’ve been the frosting). When I was in the bathroom there was someone else in the stall who was making weird sounds. I stayed in a stall shaking in disgust and dissociating. 

A few minutes later, there was an announcement to go to the auditorium for an assembly. Everyone walked there quietly. When I got there, I took a seat and looked up at like 6 students on the stage. “Happy pride month!” They shouted out in unison. Then suddenly my principal ran up to the stage and took the mic. “Schools been cancelled early due to health reasons. Please make arrangements with your parents to get picked up.” Everyone started yelling in relief and walked out to the parking lot. We were all waiting and calling our parents and another person threw up. The principal quickly brought mini pail buckets just in case more did. Once my parents got there, I got in the car and just started bawling because I was in such distress. 

School ended up being cancelled for that whole week and emails were sent out. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that it’s honestly a core memory now",0

a recent wholesome story in your life?,"My best friend is on a cross country road trip/move and she found a stray/sick/pregnant cat with sores on her and is now driving an extra 4 hours to save the cat. My partner bought me a handmade rose necklace (my favorite flower) with my birthstone in it. It was made by an extremely elderly craftsman who lives on a tiny isolated island. His name is engraved on the back of it. The kindest person I've ever met is my best friend's landlord who treated her like his daughter, protected her, encouraged her and was never ever creepy. He also won't kill a spider because it's a life too.

Those are a few short little sweet wholesome things that keep me going. There's a lot of shit going on lately, as we're all aware. But it makes it easier to get out of bed when I think about the cat she's saving, my necklace I'm gonna wear and the man who made it, and a genuinely good person who didn't let the ugly world make him ugly and still refuses to kill a spider. 

Do you have any wholesome stories of someone's kindness? Someone's skill, art and beauty? A sweet animal or your favorite thing and the tale behind it? Please warm my heart if you have the time",0
I just finished watching Game of Thrones season 8 and honestly it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be," 

Let me start off by saying season 8 is admittedly worse than the earlier seasons. The show's quality had been going downhill since season 7. I heard back when season 8 finale was released, the backlash from the fandom was absolutely insane. Everybody on the internet seemed to share the same burning hatred for the finale season. Lately i've been having a lot of free time on my hand so i decided to see for myself what the collective hatred is all about. And after watching game of thrones in its entirety i'd say the hate was justified for the most part, due to some bizarre and polarizing plot points and the pacing issue. However, i think season 8 is not without redeeming qualities. I believe most major characters ended up where they were supposed to be (minus the rushed pacing)

**Daenerys**

Out of all characters, her ending is the one that sparked the most controversies. Everyone thought her descent into madness was too abrupt and contrived, and they're not wrong. But personally i think it makes sense. Her character was always about the duality of two personas. A tyrannical megalomaniac and a good, benevolent ruler with a gentle heart. We saw glimpses of her madness in the previous seasons, but she mostly remained good throught out. This is due to her advisors (Ser Barristan, Missandei always giving her the right council. Remember when Daenerys ordered Daario to travel to Yunkai to kill all the masters and Jorah changed her mind? In season 8, all of her loyal councilors were gone, she lost her voice of reason, which ultimately caused her to burn King's Landing for seemingly no reason. I genuinely believe if Jorah didn't die during the battle of Winterfell, Daenaerys would never have done what she did.

**Jamie & Cersei**

I see many people saying the ending to Jamie's story was anti climactic and messed up his redemption arc. But I believe this is a fitting end for both of them. The clues were also scattered through out the season. Cersei told Ned Stark: We shared a womb, we came into this world together. We belong together. Jamie has reaffirmed again and again that he and Cersei are the only ones that matter. And when Bronn asked him how would he want to die, Jamie told him he wanted to die ""in the arms of the woman he loves"". His heart was always with Cersei, he couldn't stand to leave her to die alone. Like Tyrion said ""You always know exactly what she was and you loved her anyway"". Jamie is well aware that their relationship is toxic, yet he came back for her anyway despite Cersei ordered to have him killed. Just like in real life, many people can't leave their partners even though they know it's bad for them. We don't get to choose whom we love. And I do agree Cersei kinda deserved a more gruesome death for all the atrocities she commited, but i'm happy with the actual ending

**The Hound**

I think that even the people that hate can agree The Hound's story ended almost perfectly, The Hound ultimately gave in to his desire for vengeance, and died conquering both of his greatest fears: his brother, who scarred him for life and fire. The scene where The Hound convinced Arya to leave and not get consumed by vengeance like him is heart warming. One of my favorite scene in season 8. One thing that bugs me is the fighting choreography of the confrontation wasn't that good. Constantly cutting to Arya miraculously surviving the carnage in King's Landing undermined the fight a bit, but overall it's fine.

**Jon Snow**

Jon Snow has said time and time again that he doesn't want a crown, especially after he witnessed what the lust for power has done to corrupt people. Being a king and ruling kingdoms were never what he's after. He wouldn't have been happy as a King, By going back North beyond the wall, Jon got to reunite with Tormund, Ghost and the freefolk, he was finally at peace. It was also implied that Jon and the freefolk will establish a new kingdom. Jon Snow may become the next King Beyond The Wall. With that said, I'm very disappointed with his lack of agency this season. He didn't do much during the season. His dialogue was also pretty bad, parroting the same line ""you are my queen"". It makes me miss the badass, snarky Jon Snow from season 1-5.

**The Night King & White Walkers**

The way the Night King went down was admittedly a bit anticlimactic. All that build up for 7 seasons and he died from just one stab. But I think this was quite fitting. The Night King was probably aware of the azor ahai prophecy, and thought Jon Snow was the prophesied hero, so he couldn't risk engaging in 1 on 1 combat with Jon Snow. So as climactic as the idea of an epic showdown between him and Night King was, it wouldn't have made sense. My headcanon is Jaqen H'ghar knew about the Night King and the White Walkers all along, so he chose Arya and trained her to become his champion to bring down the Night King, In doing so, Arya offered to the Many Faced God the greatest tribute ever, death itself. And I thoroughly enjoyed The Long Night (minus the lighting). It was one of my favorite episodes.  
Though The Walkers storyline ended too abruptly, and left many questions unanswered (Craster's babies, the spiral symbol etc). I'm fine with what we got.

**Arya**

Her ending is okay. I don't love it, nor hate it.

**Sansa**

Sansa being crowned queen in the north is a great way to conclude her story. Even though at some points in season 8 came off as a ungrateful, entitled bitch. Her hostility towards Daenerys made me feel as though she carefully orchestrated the whole chain of events to cause Daenerys' downfall.

**Tyrion**

Tyrion has some good moments this season: his conversation with Jamie after releasing him, and when he found Jamie and Cersei in the rubble. Otherwise his characterization is reduced to that of an idiot. I don't know why Tyrion thought he could convince Cersei to surrender. He knows Cersei better than anyone. And his Bran the Broken speech at the end is just cringe worthy.

**Bran**

Frankly the idea of Bran being the King isn't that polarizing to me. He's incorruptible, just, and omniscient. Those qualities would make a good king. But unfortunately he lacks one of the most important trait, humanity. I wish the writers didn't make him an emotionless, apathetic robot. It wouldn't been nice to see Bran putting his power to good use but hey maybe that's the point. He may have manipulated everything all along using his visions so that he could become King.",0
It is interesting how age diverse Reddit is,"So I’m 30 and on some social media platforms that kinda feels like a typical age on those platforms.

Have you guys ever had 36 or 48 hour days?,"I have been awake since Friday morning and now it's Saturday Night. I have had a long day or whatever you'd call it and I have been occupied. Didn't sleep for a minute since then. I am feeling jet lagged without actually travelling through timezones (though I did do a lot of travelling and driving). Had a lot of caffiene and it will take me hours to get to sleep now. I had a little road trip ehich involved going to a few places and then coming back home, it involved about 8 hours of driving and an hour extra for picking up a few friends. All this happened under a span 12 hours. I drove for most of it. Our trip started in the morning and we came home in the morning. And I couldn't sleep then. I also had to go to another city in the evening and now I'm typing this. 

My concept of today and yesterday are fucked up. I wanted to ask do you also have these kinds of days and how do they usually go for you? Also I may not be making much sense because I'm tired, sleep deprived and I can't go to sleep and I've been way too busy.",0
I feel like I could never stay at the same exact job for more than 10 years because I would get bored. Do you feel the same way or differently?,"For example, I see people on LinkedIn who have 30 years of work experience in one job their entire life at the same exact company. I just feel like I could never do that because it would make me bored.

I can see why someone might want to stay at the same coma long time. But the same exact company and the same exact job is something that's not for me.",0
have you ever looked around and wondered how you got here?,"Growing up I often thought about high school, college, getting married but at the same time it always felt like I wouldn't live long enough to accomplish many things like that. I've graduated and married, and lately I keep thinking ""how did I get here? Did I make these decisions? Is this what I want?"" 
The last few years have been a blur - I couldn't tell you any major accomplishments or goals I achieved or even what I really want out of this existence.",0
introverts do you ever feel like hanging out? I am trying to see if it is normal that I get aggravated whenever I am asked out.,"I have this  friend that has a constant need to be around people. He had a hard time during the lockdown. He is a nice guy and I don't remember giving him my number but he constantly calls me. By the way our wives are friends and they are both introverts. He constantly forces us to hang out, calls and text and never have anything to say on the phone so I feel I have to carry the conversation. If I don't pick up on time I receive multiple missed and then he makes jokes about me not picking up or calling. I feel like I have to constantly give an account. I literally never use the phone except for the internet. My parents and close family knows how I am and  honestly they like their own space too. We all get along marvelously. I understand that I am not normal (PTSD from the military) so I try to get out of my comfort zone. To be honest I could go weeks without human interaction and I would be fine having the planet to myself.


 I feel like he is so needy, he constantly calls and checks on me and I have heard others complain about him too. He is a nice guy but I don't need that and I have communicated that with him also. At this point I think he is being selfish and checking on me has nothing to do with me but his need for conversation. I understand we all have to look out for each other and sometimes ""take one for the team"" but this is too much.

I feel like we are married at this point, he is very nosey and always asking questions that I feel only women would be interested in, example why didn't you tell me such and such is getting married, why didn't you tell me such and such was pregnant. 1. I am not the father and 2. It isn't for me to say who is getting married. Also these questions are about my family members who are somewhat close to him also. Not to mention everything he mentioned he heard from his wife through conversations she had with my wife. This is the same person who never tells me anything not that I care or if he does he tells me not to tell anyone. (Who am I going to tell? I literally go to work and come home because I am most comfortable being alone).

I told him he needs hobbies. I think if he had hobbies he wouldn't alienate people. He had a friend that they used to do everything together and looking back I don't know if I gave him any indication that I needed friends.this has been going on since 2012. 

I know I may come off as being selfish but I have tried talking to him and he isn't listening so now I am thinking of burning bridges. 

Have anyone ever dealt with anything like this? What are some other situations that you introverts have dealt with? I need to know if I am overreacting.

Edited : I forgot to add that he keeps asking me how come I don't ever call him. He doesn't give me a chance to call him because he calls so often so I never get a break. If I decide to call and get it out the way, having control of the convention and ending it when I want, he still calls later that day. we are both off on Fridays so now he thinks my Fridays belong to him. Why can't he hang with his wife? If he calls me on the way home and I answer he thinks he can call everyday at the same time. It takes me an hr to get to work and I enjoy the drive because it allows me to decompress after being surrounded by people everyday. I no longer answer all the calls but it makes me feel bad as if I am being rude but I just need a break. Now I have his wife asking me to invite him over whenever I am working in the garage. That's a HELL NO,  the garage is my safe space. For the record I am messed up in the head so I need distance.",0
Anyone else feeling like Reddit is becoming a bit toxic lately?,"Back years ago when I would get into Reddit, it used to feel so positive and welcoming.

It can be my source of motivation when I can’t find it by myself. It helps me rage crying.

Yay or Nay: buying a haunted house at a really good price,"You know most of the horror movies starts with a family from the city moving into the suburbs, into an old house that is surprisingly big for the price. But it’s haunted. And they get scared and like suffer for 2h on screen.

I think late summer in Northeast America is better than early summer and disgustingly hot midsummer.,"I'm in the Tristate area and the transition into autumn is amazing.

The air quality and nighttime temperature is comfortable. Using a fan with the window open is enough to knock me out into a well rested slumber by circulating the cool crispy air in my room all night. 

Less bad drivers on the road. It feels more relaxing to drive and safer to cycle to places. Trains are not packed in the daytime during the weekday.

Less bugs. 

Only downside would be hurricane season, but I hoping this year we don't get hit with something like Sandy or anything at all... Other than that, late summer in the Northeast has a great vibe. I think it should be considered a sub season. 

Should we have sub-seasons?",0
I just had the biggest epiphany,"This isnt a big deal to anyone except myself, and maybe to a few people who are hypersensitive to sounds. 

My whole life I've loved being in and around water. When I'd visit family that had pools, you couldn't get me out! I was jokingly called a fish just because of how obsessed I was with being in water. 

EXCEPT I hated being around waterfalls, or those ""dancing water"" shows. I would be on the verge of tears, filled with anxiety, and extremely uncomfortable. My whole life I couldn't figure out why. I love water so why don't I like these things?

It really hurts when someone does that to you. I have zero desire to talk to these people ever again. Part of me thought, ah, just be a nice person. Shit happens, it didn’t work, but continue to be friendly and keep the once-in-a-blue-moon conversation going.

I had a dream….,"I’m 47(m) My brother and I have a good relationship.

What should I do while waiting for my new phone's case and screen protector to arrive?,"I cracked my phone's screen to pieces. Given it's a few years old and all the repair shops in my area say it'll take weeks for a replacement screen to arrive, I thought I might as well get a new one. Mind you, I can't see anything on the phone as the screen has been chipped all over the place. I have my 2FA code generator there and everything so I needed something that will work soon.

I just came back from watching Minions: Rise of Gru,"Two of my cousins and my brothers went to the theatre to watch the movie, I am posting this because the theatre was insane. We went to get the limited popcorn tin and cup. The whole Dolby theatre was packed, with middle schoolers, high schoolers, adults, etc. When certain moments happened, people clapped, laughed, screamed, and cheered.

Im kinda sad my dad never buys me anything,"I know people are gonna call me spoiled, but I just want to say it somewhere.

Im 14, and my fathers a single parent. He has a really good salary, I know because he told me. He also gets good bonuses along with an extra big check to buy stuff for heath, he also gets a free phone, health care and more. Point is he has a pretty good income and has told me we are upper middle class.

Even though he makes alot, he isnt one to spend alot on stuff like hair cuts, groomers for pets, etc. Although he does buy things he wants for himself, he has limits. For two months every year though he buys alot of stuff for himself, since his work place gives him money to spend on heath stuff (But theres alot of unnecessary things you could buy with it, also edit apologies for saying it twice)

On the point, it feels like my dad never buys me anything like gift-wise. Obviously he feeds and clothes me, but other than the necessary stuff i never get gifts. He always tells me ""Just buy it yourself"" or ""Your 14, use your own money"". In a way it hurts? Some stuff i buy myself, but there's stuff that's special that i wish he would give me. Its weird, but i just want one thing to be special. It feels so unspecial If i buy it myself.

I honestly cant remember the last time i got something i wanted from my dad besides christmas/birthdays (even then gifts can be a touchy subject for him). I know he isnt a bad person, but i just wish sometimes he would see that sometimes stuff i want isnt just money down the drain",0
unbountiful harvest,"I'm a truck driver, and in recent weeks I've noticed that there are alot of fields in the Midwest not being used this year.

I started asking farmers in TN what exactly was the deal with not planting food. I was told that the price of fertilizer, diesel, seed, pesticide, and herbicide was all going through the roof....simply put...it would cost the farmers more to grow the crops than it would be to sit the year out.

Little things my friends did that made me happy,"I just recently left a school program and went home for the summer. During the program, I had felt kind of unable to connect with the other girls I lived with and really felt like nobody liked me that much. I used to struggle to make friends so I was feeling really insecure. It’s been a few weeks since I got home, and the other night one of the girls and I talked on the phone for a few hours, and it was so fun! We agreed we should call again soon, and another girl reached out and asked if we could chat soon, because she missed me! And the other day, while we were on a zoom class, one of the other girls messaged me to tell me she missed me, and that should thought I looked pretty during class (lol). 

It really made me feel so loved and made me realize that my perception is so often not the truth! I was totally wrong about how my friends felt about me, and I just feel so blessed and happy to know that I actually made some new friends!",0
Is it weird for a 26 year old to like snuggling with my 3 year old son?,"I mean he'll be 3 in August. His mother and I usually switch off weeks (sometimes I'll have him for 2 weeks like this time). I missed out on a lot of time with him during the first year, year and half (would see him periodically). I just turned 26 in March. Idk I feel like it could be looked at as weird that I show s lot of affection towards my son (a lot of kisses, cuddling, rubbing his head/back, letting his sleep on my chest or climb on my shoulders).

I haven't really been affectionate with a female in awhile and it feels like maybe it's weird for me to be so affection towards my son like I'm compensating for that or something? I don't know but I do know I love my son to the Moon and back and wouldn't change the time I have with him for the world. I often feel some kind of way towards the relationship with his mother and I but I keep that out of how I love and act towards him. 

He definitely makes my day and makes my world even if he could be a bit much sometimes lol. Wouldn't change him for the world either. I already feel like I'm not being a good enough father given my financial situation and the fact that I could be strict on him about some things, sometimes raise my voice even tho I don't want to, just seems like I lose my cool sometimes (I'm working on it and I'm constantly working at trying to become a better father and learn, I'm lucky to have my mother with me and by my side, and also thankful to his mother and her family for doing a good job when he's there), so I just want him to know that I love him, that he's loved here and that I value and want him here. I don't want him to feel unwanted or like he's a burden; he's not. I just want him to be loved and happy. But it feels like it could be weird that I'm so affectionate towards him and also don't want to come off overbearing on him and allow him space to be independent and learn. 

So is it weird that I show my son a lot of affection or should I tone it back some? I'm always brushing his hair, kissing his cheeks or forehead, giving him hugs, cuddling with him during nap time and sometimes bed time (since we share the same bed due to the fact we don't have an extra room for him here atm)? Thanks, just wondering what other people think",0

Recently I have been aspiring to become a some form of writer and to see someone that practically breathed intellect really gives me inspiration that I could rise above myself and imprint my creativity onto the world through willpower and reason.

I am the opposite of mechanically inclined but fixed my lawn tractor,"I (48m) can replace a car battery, wipers, change a tire etc, but that's about it for vehicles. Last couple of times my lawn tractor would run but stalled after a couple of minutes. I watched some YT vids and was able to change the oil & filter and air filter but it didn't fix it. I had to top up the gas and noticed a whole bunch of earwigs in the tank. No idea how they got in there. 

I didn't have a hose to syphoon the remaining gas, so I removed the bracket and hoses, and took the whole gas tank off and dumped it into a bucket, but the bugs remained because of the weird guard inside the tank. I pulled out the vacuum and a thin tube and sucked them out, put everything back together and mowed the whole lawn without stalling. I was ready to shop for a new one. It's still a piece of shit but now it runs and I saved a bunch of money. Pretty proud and relieved. Made my weekend.

Who are you living for?,"I was thinking about some of the people in my life that, from an outside view, seem to be thriving in life. “Thriving” in the sense that they had decent incomes, homes, businesses, and healthy relations with their kids. 

I had this thought that “family” can be a huge motivator for people to make healthier decisions and take on bigger challenges for the sake of caring for their family, because one focuses more on the impact they have on others, rather than self. For me though, I feel like I’m not thriving or committing to healthier choices because I don’t have a strong connection to my family or even my wife’s family. Unless I got seriously I’ll or hurt, I find it difficult to really visualize how my life really affects any of them. (It’s A Wonderful Life Syndrome, I guess.)

 I’m not unhappy or anything, but it got me asking, who AM I living for? Perhaps, if I could have that answer, it may motivate me to commit to a healthier version of myself. Before you say, “Just do it for yourself,” know that I think with a pretty low sense of ego and realize that I’m just a speck in the universe so motivation through “self” doesn’t really jive with me.

Anyhow, I’m curious to see what your answers might be and how it applies to your life. If I could answer, I’d say I live for my wife; I love her very much and know she relies on my love, my humor, and guidance. So I try to stay healthy and motivated for her as much as I can.",0

Why do people think it’s funny to be assholes?,"I went to a restaurant to order food. There was an older heterosexual couple standing in front of the ordering station. As I walk in, the guy who does the orders asked me what I wanted, so I went ahead and ordered, thinking that everyone else ordered. 

As we are waiting, the couple goes up to add sides to their order. (I thought they were just starting their order). 

As they finished and walked past me, i smiled and I apologized to them for ordering first than them. The lady smiled back and said that it was ok because they had already ordered. I said oh ok and the lady proceeds to say “you’re horrible”, while laughing about it. I thought to myself “did she just call me horrible”. I smiled and told her to have a nice day. 

Afterwards, I felt kind of played out and disappointed in myself for not having something smart to say back. I was just taken aback from what she said that I didn’t think of a good response. 

Why do people do that? They think it’s funny to be assholes and cannot muster up a nice word in response.…idk…its like she jokingly wanted to make me feel bad.",0
Anyone else have nowhere to call home?,"Now, I know in many cases it's an unfortunate matter of circumstance, but in mine I actually enjoy it.

I cannot taste the flavor of garlic. Neither can my four-year-old daughter. Are we the only ones?,"Ten years ago or so, I told my wife I thought garlic bread was overrated. It's basically just buttered bread, right? Turns out I've never actually tasted garlic. When I eat a fresh clove, it tastes mildly sweet, somewhat like a green onion. I didn't think much of it until recently when we discovered that our four-year-old daughter has the curse as well. I can *smell* garlic fine, and other flavors and spices seem to taste the same for me as for anyone else, but I'll probably never know what garlic is supposed to taste like.
