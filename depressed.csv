Depression…,Life’s got me fucked up. Live in a small rural town and can’t find a job to save my life and it’s really starting to get to me. It’s been months of putting in app after app and never anything comes thru. I’m 31 and have worked pretty much consistently since high school. Like something’s gotta give eventually right??,1
Not sleeping,"I haven’t had a real good night’s sleep in about 2 years now, sometimes I’m really physically active, sometimes I’m not but it doesn’t make a difference anyway

I’m sure I have depression, I thought it was supposed to make me tired, I actually am tired throughout the day I feel slow and lazy af but I can never actually sleep, I’ve read that it’s kinda common, but is there anything I can do besides taking meds?",1
when will it get better,I'm pretty young I'm a white male and for the longest time I've felt sad like a wired sad sometimes I'm happy but deep down I know that it won't last on the surface I'm fine but I'm not and it just won't stop every night I cry every night I want it to be the end but I don't want to die like I don't want to kill myself but if someone tried to kill I wouldn't stop them and every time someone asked me if I'm fine I say yes but I don't know why and it hurts but I don't want to be a failure I don't want waist my life but I don't know how to be happy like truly happy I feel like I lie to myself and I've fallen into some dark abyss that I'm stuck in just how do I feel better,1
"what is wrong with me, why do i keep failing at the things i want most","I don't know what's so wrong with me that everyone I meet rejects my friendship. It's not even worth trying anymore. on top of that I've been unemployed for two years so there's literally no opportunities to meet anyone, anyway. and even if i tried meeting people through meetups, it never goes beyond aquaintanceship. I don't have a single irl friend left. I'm pathetic.

I've thought about this for years and years, like, ""What am I doing wrong?"" or ""Why did she reject me?"" (purely platonic as I'm a girl), and I'm always at a mental dead end. The simplest answer is that I'm worthless. It would explain everything, my unemployment, my lack of friends, my ugliness.  But my therapist says I'm not worthless, and if what she said is true, then the answer becomes 100 times more complicated.

I still haven't figured out the answer.",1
Left alone with ideation,"I feel so trapped in my marriage. He claims to love me, but doesn’t show it. Apparently everything I do is wrong and he’s perfect. I broke down asking what does he want me to do or what can we do to get better. He got offended I mentioned marriage counseling. I struggle with depression and have been trying to work on not needing medicine, but I literally reached out to my husband that I don’t want to be alive anymore and all he did was walk past me. I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation and I try to talk about it with him and he just says it’s my bluff to guilt trip him. I’ve tried ODing before. Self harm. I’m begging him to help me or not leave me alone with my thoughts and yet here I am posting from my bathtub while he’s playing video games. He doesn’t “want to talk to me.” Is life truly worth it? I always said it was because of my kids, but it’s getting harder to fight these urges",1
feeling realy down today,Feeling realy down today I'm having trouble figuring out how to make it through the day at work keep locking myself in the bathroom to cry and let it out why is it so hard to find a Dr every one wants you to wait months to see them myasthenia Dr dropped me for not comming in for 6mo,1
Favourite co worker has left,"I’m so sad.  My favourite coworker of 6 years has left.  She was the only one who I really connected with.  I’m an introvert and have a very small circle, but with her I could talk for hours.  People even said we were like a duo.  Now I feel like a part of me is gonna be missing at work.  Will I eventually feel better and move on?",1
idk what else there is,"Ever since losing her I've felt no connection to anyone. I feel like that was it for love. I don't even know if I care anymore. I've come to terms with the fact that I had my chance at love and i fucked it up. I also Just had to have my dog put down today, had an abscess that burst and any kind of surgery wasn't really an option given her age. Any happiness I feel at this point feels like eating candy. It tastes great and gives you that dopamine for 5 seconds, then you just regret all the sugar you ate. All I do at this point is disappoint people that care about me and all I do is get disappointed in myself. Whenever I hype myself up and try to feel positive about myself I know that deep down im just lying to myself. Everyone tells me the same shit about how it'll get better, you'll find someone, you'll get better, you'll make new friends, yada yada, the same bs copy paste response that everyone gives. No one gets it, and frankly I'm tired of people pretending that they do.",1
I’m jumping off a cliff in August. I know none of you care so why am I posting this. Just to see if anyone feels the same. Depression has killed me. See you in another world.,No one cares about me. Literally no one has helped me. I’ve never had anyone who loved me. No one who cared about me. Every day gets worse and worse. I’m jumping off a cliff on august 6th and I already know where. So goodbye world.,1
can't even mentally function,"I'm just not real. It feels like I was never here and never will be, but at the same time everything is so real. I'm not in control of myself, but I feel the guilt of every decision good or bad. I've tried to kill myself, but it was a lame attempt. Ik all my friends and family care about me and love me, but that's not the issue. I hate everything about myself. I feel guilty for just being alive and having anybody emotionally attached to me. I don't want therapy or meds because God knows they won't help. Nothing is fun and it's been nearly a year since I felt fulfilled by a day. I don't know how much I can take.",1
I am just really exhausted with life.,"I am really tired of being exhausted from work school and being unemployed. And yes many will say its normal but like I am personally sick of it bcause I have nothing else in my life that makes it worthwhile.

Im sick of my body, im sick of my life I work sleep and live with my parents in a tiny apartment when im not being manipulated by my coworkers and manager im being manipulated by my parents.

My alarm is ringing. i dont want to get up but my parents will probably make me.

I just wish my cancer would come back and kill me so I dont have to kill myself.

Ive been trying therapy but I think my unhealthy coping mechanisms or dissassociating and numbing myself out is all I actually can do. I dont have any control over my life and honestly at this point life has nothing to offer me. I should kill myself but if I mentally and emotionally disengage I will be able to survive and be absolutely miserable, which may not be bette but at this point my parents are more invested in my life more than I am so I guess suffering is ok until they die, then I can kill myself guilt free.",1
I'm alive just because I don't have the courage to commit suicide.,"I(28M) just want to die. Erased fron existence. I just can't take it anymore. I'm so f**king tired. 

My family will be in misery for sometimes but they'll be ok eventually. Apart from them no ones life will be affected. 
I'm a nobody. I've nothing to live for. No love interest, no real friends. 

I was pretty good at my job but my boss always gave a hard time. I hated it so much that every morning I went out wishing to die of an accident. Now, I don't even have that. 

The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm a coward and don't have the courage to commit suicide. Every f**king day I pray to God for my death. But if things go on like this, then maybe, maybe I'll be brave for one last time and end my life myself.",1
Depression is setting in,Things lose their meaning at this point. Feeling frustrated because I didn’t find a way to feel better. I have been trying for years and it got worse. Then I always feel suicidal. I do not want to be alone.,1
10:26 am CST,My dog died months ago. My kids are with there mom for the week... and me? Im just sitting here cry.  Everyone abandons me. Why am I always alone? I keep hoping a gun will appear. I will end it. Make everyone on this planet happy. Sometimes I think if I kill myself the world would go into a time of happiness and love.  I almost died when I was a little kid. Almost fell off a mountain. .maybe I did and this is hell? Why would I deserve hell though? I was only like 8 or 9 at the time and did nothing to anyone.... sigh. Tired of this life.  I wish I could donate all my organs so good people can live long happy lives and I can die.,1
"Just came out of a month long depression. Feel better, but no appetite .","I have had anxiety since I was a child. I’m thirty now and a mom of a toddler and work full time. I always deal with my responsibilities despite my depression “eras”. I call them eras because they don’t last forever but I don’t realize I’m in them because it just starts to feel normal. I care for my son so I have to obviously put my depression aside, as difficult as that is. 
     Depression for me looks like over eating to feel something, not caring about appearance, doing the bare minimum, forcing myself to be social, sleeping way too much and feeling tired ALL DAY, and crying all the time… sometimes even rage. I’m typically more anxious than depressed so it’s a weird experience for me. 

Anyways, I’ve recently been in a shorter era of depression. About 4-5 weeks. I have just now realized how depressed I was because now I’m feeling much better and feel like healing and seeking therapy. 

But the strangest thing is I can’t eat a damn thing. I’ve been munching on things here and there and just drinking water. Even when I felt sick from hunger, I couldn’t eat. I have lost 5 pounds in 4 days. I have a lot of energy and I feel fine. I’m just not sure what this is. My friends and family tell me I should just enjoy this season of happiness because this too , shall pass. But part of me is just wondering what is happening to my brain? I don’t take any medications and I don’t drink alcohol. I live a good life but mental health is always a struggle.",1
Its back with a vengeance,"I'm going through a bit of a down moment after one meh therapy session and an impulsive thought. 

Does anyone else spiral when it gets like this sometimes? I mean spiral, like feeling my old symptoms of ""this isn't reality"", ""just eat the bottle of meds"", not caring about anything, not showing as much emotion or having the energy to muster emotional responses, no energy to do the things that make me feel good about myself, horrible sleep and eating schedules (if I eat much at all). 

I just got through with a long long bout of this all last year and into January of this year. Therapy and meds have worked thus far, even with the changes to my meds that helped me feel less numb. I'm tired of this, and of feeling fragile. Idk if its just the process of getting to a manageable point.... does anyone else get like this?",1
please help me i’m begging,"it’s like everything i do, i think abt something not being “perfect”. i avoid so many things just because i think they won’t be perfect. i don’t know how to get this to go away and i’ve had it since end of 2020 and it gets better sometimes then really bad like if something’s not perfect in my mind i meltdown and basically shut down for the rest of the day and i just want to do stuff without a voice in my head and sick feeling in my stomach controlling me. and everyone says “it’s ok, just go with the flow, everything doesn’t have to be “perfect”. AND I KNOW THAT. I DON’T LIKE HAVING THIS AND I DON’T THINK PERFECTION IS ACHIEVABLE AND I DON’T EVEN WANT TO ACHIEVE IT IF IT IS. IT JUST WON’T STOP. it’s not a switch, i would turn it off in a second if i could, IT JUST DOESN’T WORK LIKE THAT THO. I JUST WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT THIS PLEASE",1
"I'm just done, but can't follow through","Honestly, I'm just done with life & everything that it has to offer.

The thing is that I have made a decision that life is pointless and I would be better off hiding away from everyone or just dead. But I can't bring myself to follow through with my decision, something is stopping me and I'm not sure what it is.",1
It doesn’t even hurt anymore I just feel empty,"For the longest when I got suicidal it was because life became so much it was painful to stay alive. Right now I want to end it because I feel nothing. I feel like I am just tolerating life, I am not actively engaging with it, things are just  happening and I let them happen. I see no point in keep going I see no point in living. The only thing I feel is empty. And lonely. I wish someone would intimately hug me and tell me everything is going to get better but I don’t feel close to anyone in my life. People are just there. I am just kind of there. I don’t want to keep going.",1
"I’m tired, scared and lonely…","I feel like this because I have been trying to settle all the facts that foresee the succession for three months, three months that I do not study because I do not have the head to do it, three months in which I do not ask anyone for help because the only person who could do it is my father.
In three months I learned to be a man, to know how to move between banks, courts, judges, accountants, construction engineers; I learned how loans are made and how to avoid usurious rates, I learned to cook, to move around my country without using a GPS or a road map.
I learned not to be myself anymore because I realized that this world rejects introverted and weak people...
No one can refer a young boy in his twenties if not his own father.
A brother, a cousin, an uncle, not even the same mother can help you in certain areas.
I have learned almost everything there is to know to be able to live without being fooled except one thing: yet another refusal of a girl you love...
A son talks about these things with his father. I wish Dad was here... I already know what he’d say: ""Still upset are you ?! Stop it. She doesn't want you? Go on! Go out and have fun, don't dwell on ONE girl. You will have time to fall in love again, now you just have to look come on.""
I can only be lifted by HIS words and not by others.
I'm tired of being rejected every single time, and every time it has happened it's just because they don't know me. But I say ""Go out with me, get to know me. See how I really am and then if you don't like me okay, I understand you. But please don't dwell on the usual mental barrier where men are all assholes.""
Unfortunately, I am capable of loving and even too much. That's what keeps me from being strong. I don't know how to be a son of a bitch who passes a girl every week or more a month, I don't know how to be an asshole. I need the feeling to be with someone…

A little while ago I was with a girl I was supposed to go to the cinema with tonight. We've been together all afternoon, laughed and talked. When I brought her home less than ten minutes later she wrote me ""Matthew, anyway I don't want to go out tonight"".
What did I do wrong? I didn't offend you, I showed you my university, I offered you ice cream, I made you laugh, I managed to make you confide how you feel these days. And now, suddenly, you don't want to go to the cinema with me anymore? Why...?
Dad, what should I do now? These months are already a shit without you, now that I had found someone to talk to openly this refuses me. Why...?",1
any advice on how to stop overthinking?,"I keep overthinking about stuff that I don't want to think about, it's causing me to be extra depressed and want to give in to impulsively acting out, I'm trying to work past my impulsive control issues. 

Any advice on how to stop overthinking is greatly appreciated:)",1
I’m so tired of suffering,"Nobody cares or understands what I’m going through. When I try to vent about my issues, people just reply back to me saying my troubles make them feel grateful they don’t have my issues in their life, which makes me feel worse. My former coworkers even said they never knew anyone with as much bad luck as me.

Parents are getting divorced because my mom wants a guy younger than me. My mom and I used to be super close and now she wants me out of her life. She said she raised her kids and now it’s time for her to live her life. I later found out she wasn’t the person I thought she was. She used to like being a homebody, doing crafts, baking, loved watching old tv shows. Now she’s changed into a sex addict who likes to go out to bars, clubbing and hanging out with much younger guys. (She’s 65)

I’m disabled with Asperger’s, no friends, socially inept, lived with my parents my whole life, ugly, never dated or had a boyfriend. I don’t do well with people so it’s hard to keep a job. I’ve had multiple therapists, taken anxiety meds, tried working retail or jobs where I had to mainly interact with people to come out of my shell and nothing worked. Wherever I work I get bullied by my coworkers or fired because I don’t know how to deal with people. 

My dad worked very hard to put away money so I could survive after he and my mom passed away but with the divorce the money is all gone. I will no longer inherit my childhood home where I felt safe. That house had a lot of sentimental value plus my childhood pets are buried there.  I’m now living with my dad in an apartment, which I hate. I constantly have to wear earplugs or take ibuprofen because the neighbors are so loud. I have panic attacks and can’t sleep at night. There is no yard to hang out in and no privacy. If I go outside the people across the street yell mean/creepy things at me while sitting on their porch. I cant take a walk around the neighborhood or go to a nearby park because it’s too dangerous so I’m stuck inside 24/7. 

My siblings are all well off and cut me out of their lives because I’m a failure and a loser. I have no friends and no support except for my dad. The only way things could ever get better is if I had enough money to buy a house in a quiet area. Because I’m on social security and the divorce drained our finances, I’ll never have anything. What makes things worse is that everyone I know is well off. My aunt and uncle are divorced but each has at least a million or more in the bank. My cousins are horrible people who make fun of me for my disability but yet they will inherit millions of dollars. I see my childhood bullies on social media in high paying jobs, going on vacations, buying nice houses. Siblings are very wealthy.  My hairdresser just inherited over 300 acres of land from her mother plus a half a million. I hate to sound entitled but I feel like I need the money more than some of these people. My problems would be solved if I didn’t have to worry about money and trying to survive. I tried so hard to fit into society but my social issues keep me from being successful. I don’t think I was meant for this world…",1
Numb.,"It's been 8 years since the biggest trauma in my life happened. 3 years back is where that trauma sinked in to me, I was too shock that it sinked in to me very late. I went through depression after that. I don't blame those people who caused my trauma instead I blamed myself. I kept asking myself that if I did something, would I be happy now and free from trauma?. Those time were the darkest months of my life, I cried myself to sleep every night and acted like i'm okay at day until a certain someone entered my life. That certain someone made me feel strong and I felt reponsible of being okay because I know that I will be her sister and I need to be a strong image for her. She healed me but I lose her, I was in shock for a couple of months but I didn't show it to anyone. I had always acted like i'm okay and nothing could ever make me depress.

Past forward to now, there's so many things that's happening in my life. I thought that I am too numb to feel anything but darkness is slowly pulling me in this hole again and again. I keep asking myself if I see myself being alive in the future and the answer is no. I am slowly feeling numb, too numb to even speak or process the fact that the only way for me to sleep is to cry myself to sleep every night again.",1
I'm 18m and God knows how long I've been depressed for,"It's on and off for me, at times I think I can move on but it all ends up back to me being depressed. I had 1 good thing in my life for a couple of weeks but that went away and she's never coming back. My depression has been getting worse from there and now I just don't have energy for anything. All I want in my life is just to be alone forever like literally meaning solitary confinement in a cell somewhere. I've had depression for about 3 or 4 years now but I'm getting to understand it more now. There's some good people in my life that I talk to online and without them idk what I would've done. Just a little rant about my life, kind of hate it tbh. I don't want to lie to myself anymore about thinking things could get better coz ik they can't. I don't lie to my friends though but only to myself. No one irl knows about my depression and I'm not planning on telling anyone. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. FML :) I hate it",1
How’d you know you’re depressed?,"I (18F) have been showing signs of depression, and although I don’t want to self diagnose, I also don’t want to go to a doctor just to find out that I’m not depressed.

I have been sleeping a lot more lately. I have been angry about a lot of things, and I’m not able to hold my emotions. I feel like I don’t have the strength to do anything that involves moving, so I often lie down and fall asleep again.",1
i stop enjoying life,"My main lenguage is spanish im doing my best to write this

So, my name is chris guys, im 22 yrs old, im from latin america, i was working but im recently searching for a job, anyways, the reason why im writing this, cis because i have no one to talk to,  i was goimg to therapy and i was diagnose with extreme depression and eating disorder, sometime qhenni get too depress i dont want to even eat, i wake up at 1 o clock every day, i almost no sleep and go to bed to 5am, sometimes 6 or 7,  i feel a social pressure and feel like no matter where i go or what i do im gerring judge and watched, i dont feel that i desersved my family, i dont think i deserved my girlfriend, i feel that i lost something, i cant be happy arround happy people, i get to uncomfortable when im in a group of ppl having a good time, and its frustrating, i get anxious when im alone, when i left my gf house, she live with her mother too well his family just like me, i have this bug on my head and voices, telling me that im bad, that im ugly, i dont deserve her, and stuff like that, i really have suicidal thinks, sometime i dont even know if i can get throught this, that im better dead.

I have lost alot of good person, and when i was on the funeral i wasnt even crying because i didnt knew how to react, every day i wake up, and i feel down, sometimes i wakeup in the middle of the night, screaming, sometimes i wake up crying.

I have been feeling this way for 9 years, since i was 12 or 11ni cant remember, and with alot of existencial crisis and more, i dont think this i a good idea neither, at the moment im writing this the bug in my head is annoying me and saying that its a waste of time and ppl will not care at all, so i dont wait nothing.

I have nothing to do, i have no idea what to do, i get close and close to end this in a matter of sec, and i have try it 5 times, but im still here.

I dont know what to do guys.",1
"feeling lost, hopeless",i find that i have dealt with feeling this way for awhile. growing up i was dirt poor fat and ugly always outcast and alone i had no better time with my parents or home life i feel like things just have never gotten better. im now an alcoholic with two pending dwis last time almost killing myself when i wrecked and im just constantly home and asleep no idea when ill get pulled over doing an errand and just get slammed in jail ive been applying to jobs to at least try and get out of the house but havent heard anything back yet my id expired early next month so need something fast. was talking to a girl went on a date once and talked a bit more but now have not heard anything back from her. still havent really gotten over my last ex either i suppose. idk just feel like my life is pointless and going no where i dont have anyone there to really talk to that i havent drove away already just eh whatever thanks for reading if you did.,1
I’m losing it,"I’ve (26m) been in a progressively worsening mood. My temper is getting shorter and shorter and I’m demonizing and lashing out at the only people there for me. I can’t find the energy to get through my ever growing check list of things. Social interaction stresses me out I’m always tired and wired. Working out is the only time I have peace but I feel like I’m getting more and more aggressive and it’s hard to even get myself to the gym all I want to do is sleep. I feel like myself for a few hours out of the day and then I get sent down a rabbit hole and end up back in this crazy angry hateful mindset. I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 7, I’ve been on 5 different types of meds. I live a very healthy life style. I have a good job. A loving girlfriend, a family that cares, friends, a dog. I have no reason to be unhappy, I have no reason to be angry. I’m so fed up with everything. I keep getting in these moods where I start scheduling my own death, just to shake myself from all that. I’ve started getting violent thoughts, I used to get them as a teenager. It’s stuff I have no intention on acting on but I don’t know why they come up. I just want to be happy. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Multiple psychiatrists have conflictingly diagnosed me, therapy seems to just wind me up or worse the pr branch of my brain kicks in and just says what I’m supposed to say. Maybe I’m just part of the species that was beneficial in the wild and should die off since I can’t mesh with civilization. 

Im so sick of being an ungrateful shit. I don’t know why I can’t be happy. No real point just need to vent and hopefully convince myself that I’m normal and there is hope.",1
"i know i’m not alone in how i feel, but i can’t convince myself of that","this is gonna be messy but i need to get words out so they don’t keep bouncing around in my head. 

I’m a 23 yr old college grad(degree in finance) with no idea what to do with myself.  The last few years of college and up till now have been some of the worst years of my life, starting with the death of one of my closest friends in a car crash at the end of 2019.  My depression extends back further than that, but this experience was a turning point for the worse and covid showed up almost immediately after that.  

I spend most of my days alone now, while my girlfriend works.  I’ve been dealing with physical health issues that caused me to take time away from work to try and better myself, but now the money is starting to run out and I can’t seem to scramble to get a decent job fast enough to get a steady income again to pay the bills…I am in a mess of credit card debt and other debts, with no income and no vision and no path, clueless and alone.  

My gf works but hardly enough to support herself, and we both are in very similar situations family wise and mentally(being that she does not communicate with her family anymore due to past conflicts and same with parts of my family). So in a sense it’s just the two of us.  Most of my friends are graduated and moved away from the town my university is in (I still live there).  I have no idea how to be social anymore or to make friends or really even be a human anymore. 

Every day i just sit and question why anyone does anything. What is the purpose of accomplishing anything on this earth when the time comes none of it truly means anything.  I feel suicidal at times but I almost hate myself to much to even bring myself to that point, I don’t think I could physically allow myself to do that but i have about as little left of a will to live as I can get. therapists don’t understand and the healthcare system only cares about getting their money and can’t move fast enough to bother helping figure out what’s wrong with me. 

I don’t know who to turn to or where to go from here. I need help, I need some sort of guidance and friendship and to feel like things matter again. and i don’t just mean help as in suggesting i go talk to a professional. i promise i’m already on your suggestion’s waiting list or been turned away due to lack of accepting new patients.  

i need to figure out how to manage my bills, help support my girlfriend where i can and climb out of this debt hole as soon as may be possible because my sanity has reached a very thin line to the edge.  for those of you willing to read through all this, thank you.",1
im depressed,"don’t know how else to put it but simply. 
nothing surprises me anymore life is shit. 

i don’t have regular sleep, hobbies, anyone to talk to. i use social media to distract myself then get mad at myself for enveloping myself in it and wasting time. my life is barely starting and i choose to waste it away. 

i know they say it gets worse before it gets better but when does it stop getting worse?",1
I have PTSD anxiety from a traumatic thing I can’t stop thinking about and it’s my fault,"I am a 14m. About a year ago, I made a big mistake and since then I can’t be the same. Im here to tell my story just in case I do something. I was born march 13 2008. I grew up learning to do everything by myself I was very independent and I’m usually smart. Usually. Not this one day though. I was going through puberty when this happened. Very hormonal is a word. I met this girl who I thought I could trust. I sent her a “nude” as people today call it. Next thing I knew it was everywhere on the internet. More than that, I was tortured online by someone who had even more stuff of me idek how. Even my address. Now I’m not one of the people who diagnoses themselves but Ik it’s clear. I have anxiety, every time I walk by a group of people, all I could think or panic about was if they know, do they hate me, will they jump me. And PTSD speaks for itself, I think of it everyday, every hour, how did this pass. How did I let this happen. I also have nightmares about it. I don’t wanna live like this. I’m gonna give in. I’m gonna give in.",1
lonely,"I just feel lonely, my brother, everybody i know just going out with friends or playing with them online.
I feel for few years that thing. I don't have any hope about change. 
Now i know, for me is only singleplayer games (multiplayer not, because I always lost, and i see that people play with someone and it make me sad)",1
Alone,"I cannot take this depression anymore.  I am so alone, and my depression worsens by the day.  Every day I wake up, I ask myself what's the point of getting out of bed?   What's the point of having a cell phone?  No one ever calls me to check up on me.  I used to be the guy that would always help, always call and check up on people, but when I need someone, anyone no one is there.  I used to make time for everyone, but that is done and over.  I saw a Tik Tok the other day that I related to 100%.  If I told you I only had a year left to live, what would you do?  One of the responses was, I wouldn't say shit to anyone.  What's the point?  You don't talk to me now, I do not want you to be a fake ass person and all of a sudden care about me because you know that I am dying.  I would rather be alone and spend the last year with my family.  This hit me so hard, because I know shit would change if people heard this.  It really makes a person think.  Would anyone really miss me if I was gone?  Would they show up at my funeral, cry, give condolences, and totally forget about me?  I was always there for people, but they blew that.  If you want to give a shit, give a shit while I am still alive.  I just wish they could see how bad I am hurting and help me now that I need it the most.  I am so alone.  I just want to wake up and have someone by my side who cares about me.",1
Question: Has anyone else felt like their cognitive functions have dropped since they've gotten more depressed?," 

Hi,  here's some context for this: I have persistent depressive disorder,  and got diagnosed at a college psychiatry department when I started my  first semester. I've since dropped out due to difficulty in school and  it's been about two years. I thought about when it seems like my trouble  first started and it was when I was suffering academically in high  school. I was never perfect at school but something about junior year  hit me hard and my grades and motivation dropped, getting worse and  worse as the months went on.

This  continued until I was all the way in college and struggling so horribly  in school it felt like I literally couldn't function anymore. I mean it  felt like my brain was fried constantly, I had so much trouble retaining  anything I learned in class and focusing on doing work or having the  motivation that I only passed classes by staying up until 2-4 AM every  night (even then I never fully finished any of my work). Most of the  time I would just sit there and my brain felt completely shut down no  matter what I did, and I ended up having a few breakdowns and I'd just  wander around the school at night lost and confused because it felt like  I just couldn't do anything anymore.

But  I'm still bugged by it because it feels like it even fucked up my  ability to think. Like when I talk to people I can't formulate proper  words sometimes and trying to makes me so tired. I've listened to myself  talk and my words are much more slurred and confused sounding than they  used to be. I can barely remember things people tell to me unless I sit  there and force myself to think about it over and over again. It feels  like my brain has legitimately deteriorated and it's made me scared to  go back to school and extremely self-conscious about interacting with  literally anyone. So I really want to know if anyone else is going  through the same thing and if anything has helped..",1
havent been happy for over 9 years,"is this normal not being able to feel any type of joy since the age of 11 and i dont even know what is dragging me down. i just dont feel normal not being able to enjoy life how it was meant to be enjoyed. i just see everyone so happy now and days, is there something wrong with me there is times where i cut my self to feel some type of enjoyment and its been working honestly cutting help out a lot.",1
I don’t want to be here,Another late night of me thinking the same thoughts I don’t feel like genuine happiness is in the cards for me ever again I don’t want to be here anymore yet I have not done anything about that I need a hug I need to know it gets better but all I see is this dark tunnel with no light at the end. I don’t want to be here I don’t want to feel constant emptiness the same stuff I ramble on about I don’t have anyone to talk about it to anymore. I just feel like some days I’m getting better and other days I take a huge step back. Help me please.,1
I have no friends,"I was always popular in school. Plenty of friends and always someone to talk to and be with. Fast forward 2 years Im out of school and I have a girlfriend. I stayed close with 2 or 3 friends from school and I introduced them to each other and it got to the point where I just felt like I was the one left out of the friendship. we had a massive argument at the start of this year and while we have made up now things are just not the same at all. I barely see them now and I’ve drifted apart from my other friends as I got sober and lost a few that I would’ve done drugs with, and I attempted suicide and pushed some away so drifted apart from another few. My best friend when overseas for university and I can feel us drifting apart too. I hate how lonely it is. I work full time and don’t have any time to socialise but that’s a good thing for me because I don’t have anyone to socialise with except my girlfriend and I live with her so I see her everyday anyway. I’m too anxious to even think about making new friends and I can’t reach out to my old friends because it was me who pushed them away. My girlfriend went on holiday with her mum for a week and I’ve just realised how pathetic my life is. I had 3 days off work and I’ve lay in bed for 3 days because I have no friends I can meet up with. I feel like hurting myself again despite being 5 months clean. I’m so lonely",1
I need a hug,"I thought I was getting better. I guess not, because here I am on this subreddit.

I’m not suicidal, but I have no desire to really live. I haven’t been making progress in life. Not that I have a future to live for anyway.

I have so many issues to deal with. I’m a college dropout, unemployed, and living with my parents. They love me, but I know I’m a burden on them. I’m severely overweight and have addictions to fast food and sugar. Speaking of addictions, I spend a lot of time looking at pornography and masturbating. I should also mention that I’m on the autism spectrum, so there’s that.

Most of my day I do nothing. I either pace around the house listening to metal, or I lie down in bed cuddling my plushies. I used to play video games, but I got bored with that quickly. Books also stopped entertaining me. They feel more like a chore anyway.

I don’t really know what I’m trying to get at. I think I just need a hug. That would hopefully solve some of my problems or help me make progress in life.",1
"I don't think I am depressed but I feel like I don't enjoy anything and If I do, I only enjoy it for a couple minutes and still at the end of every day I feel empty","I am currently 19. I never really been ""depressed"" but lately after working at a really low pay check job and breaking up with my girlfriend things have started to just feel numb. I of course quit my low pay check job and got a lot better one which I actually like but the thing about the girlfriend was that she was depressed and as I tried helping her for the 2 months we were together I felt myself just becoming the same person as her and now here i am.. Nothing wrong with my life, doing decent in school, no extra stress caused by my ex, a good job and good friends but still at the end of every day I just feel like I have no point in life, i got no interest in life.. im not excited for anything and I just don't know if I am overeacting or something is actually wrong with me things sometimes get to the point where i start thinking if I should just end it cause there is no point. if anybody with experience with this type of thing could give me some tips would be great as I've seen a couple other threads on this community asking for help i thought maybe someone here could give me some help.(Sorry for the bad english it isen't my main language)",1
it's my birthday tomorrow,"it's my birthday tomorrow and I have nobody to celebrate with. I have no friends or close family to do anything with. I wish I had people in my life, I'm so tired of being so alone. I've tried making friends but for the life of me can't. Why am I so unlikeable?",1
Therapy is not working and I find myself skipping more and more.,"That's pretty much it. I can't open myself enough, so my therapy is mostly just me talking how shitty my week was, having ""have you tried not being a bitch"" said to me and then just sitting there until the last minutes pass. 

I haven't been there for about a month and I don't feel particularly worse or better. Even if objectively, this is height of my life, I feel as miserable and suicidal as I've felt for the ladt 3 years. Does the therapy get better? Does anything get better past this point? I am repeatedly told that step into adulthood is the begining of a decline, and if that's the case, why live for it all to only get worse?",1
"First breakup in a very long time, can’t handle it","Had an intense D/s relationship with a boy for about five months where I took care of him, helped him through religious trauma, helped him move out of his parents’ house at 27, helped him come to terms with his bisexuality and have confidence in himself, then he goes behind my back to get with an ex that he previously badmouthed to me and claimed not to be interested in. When I returned his possessions, he had the gall to tell me to my face that I “didn’t deserve him”.

Now I’m dealing with feelings of abandonment, betrayal and violation. I’m so scared that he’s telling people things about me that I told him in confidence and that they’re laughing at me. 

They became “Facebook official” today and even though I was expecting it, I have been shaking and holding back tears at work all morning. I hate that I’m letting him have this much power over me. I know now that he’s a selfish, greedy, ignorant little brat, but damnit, I cared about him, and he knew that. I never wanted it to end this way. 

What can I do to make this not hurt so much?",1
No fight left,Basically that’s it. I’m just tired of being the way I am and I just don’t have it in me to fight anymore.,1
so afraid to sleep,"I've posted about this here before, not too long ago actually. A few people reaches out saying they struggle with similar issues.

 It's bothering me again, and it feels like it's gotten worse. I basically do everything I can not to sleep until 2am. I'll distract myself with whatever I can, a book, a game, tiktok hell I'll just lay awake looking at the ceiling. Basically whatever I can get my hands on if it means I don't have to close my eyes. 

I suffer from anxiety and depression. Life feels overwhelming, im in my early 20s and now I have to take responsibility and carve my own path to success. I'm incredibly privileged though, I live at home with parents who don't really care that I'm a gay, anxiety ridden social reject. Yet I still hide away from everything. I'm practically worthless. Somehow I've managed to keep up with university and maintain decent grades. I even have a decent social life. But behind all that, I'm absolutely terrified. I can't sleep due to the fear of waking up the next morning and having to go about my day. 10pm onwards has this stillness about it, a quiet calm where nothing is expected of me. I dont have to feel any guilt about being holed up in my room or not being productive. I'm not wasting time.

In reality, I want to sleep. I want to get things done and pursue a career. I want to talk with my friends and have fun. But even the familiar has become a hurdle. A hurdle that keeps growing. 

I suppose I'm sick and tired of constantly being on edge. I want to feel at least a little more normal.",1
How do you even form habits?,"I honestly cant think of a single habit I have

I don't eat at the same time everyday.

I don't go do bed or wake up at the same time everyday.

I can't even force myself to brush my teeth on a regular schedule which is surprising given how religiously my parents tried to get me to brush twice a day. Now i go weeks without brushing.

Everything I do is based on impulses or random spurs of motivation. I'm probably one of the least disciplined people alive and nothing I try ever seems to change that.",1
"I feel sad, angry, helpless and worthless everyday all day","haven't been genuinely happy in life since I was 10 years old(currently 25, male) and it's exhausting. 
Everything about my life and the events that have transpired in it, my appearance specifically my face, my job and current stressers have me just down all the time. Mixed with the fact that my brain doesn't shut off all the bad things when I'm not pre occupied mentally. I just can't help but think of every bad thing or thing that makes me sad or angry . It's exhausting, especially at work where I'm worked like a horse but it takes no mental capacity to do. 
I have extreme hatred for myself. My face and everything about it is ugly. I'm a male but have a small and narrow face. Recessed fave with a weak jaw bad teeth and lips. I'm ugly as all get out. 
My personality isn't good. I'm boring and get angry way to easy . I have no interests or passions in life aside from MTG, which I haven't played much bc I just don't care much anymore. I get depressed easily. I don't go out bc I envy literally every male that passes for being average or attractive while I'm stuck as this monster .
On top of all this I just have this inability to be happy. I'm stuck at a job I don't want that (boring long day factory bs. 120 degrees daily qnd miserable). I have 2 ex that I have children with. One won't stop putting my oldest in danger. The other I haven't seen in a year bc my ex won't let me see him, court for the first 6 months didn't favor me. We were supposed to make a deal and her offer was unreasonable . I couldn't come up with a counter offer and then I've been to broke to afford a lawyer for 8 months since then bc I have to put my resources into the other child that's actually jn danger. I get i have to but I cry literally every day missing my youngest boy and is probably the worst and most depressing thing to me right now. He doesn't even remember me probably and last time I saw him he could barely walk and now a year later he can probably talk in sentences. I dont know what he looks like anymore and I wanna just scream and cry all at the same time. He means everything to me and my heart breaks every day . 
My current relationship is falling a part. Lots of fighting bc I'm to insecure and say it. Don't get out. She also has lots of anger issues and us both having mental issues doesn't work.
I'm so broke and the world is so hard to make it in right now that with the two of us both working 40 hour jobs we can't get out of my frigging grandma and moms house . Don't get me started on my issues with my grandma and mom. I'll be here all day. 
I dont know what to do to get out of this hole. I feel like I am just doomed to never be happy or content.  Especially the stuff with my ugly face and even more, the stuff with my son if I don't see him soon. 

Thanks for reading my rant if you made it this far.",1
I’m stupid.,"I’m the first one to show up, the first one to offer help, the first one to support, and the first one to uplift anyone in my life. 

When I need someone they can’t make it, when I need help they watch me suffer, when I need support they make fun of me, and when I need to be uplifted they talk about themselves. 

I invest time, money, energy, and love into everyone I’m close with because I’ve kept my circle small and each of them don’t have my back. I put all this effort into all these people and I don’t get shit back for it. And the worst part is I never ask for help, they people in my life will see me struggle and tell me no beige I ask, and then if I say no they throw a fit. 

These are the people in my life, this is the mess I allowed to happen, and now I’m miserable and just stupid.",1
I am not fine.,"People think I’m fine because I say I am, but I’m not. I haven’t been diagnosed or anything, but I feel extremely anxious and depressed. I feel like I can’t tell anyone. I feel like they’ll say “Your too young to be depressed” or “It’s just something he found on YouTube.” But it isn’t. I actually do self harm, normally around my wrist, and no one notices. Also, I am probably not old enough to get on Reddit but I don’t give a fuck. I don’t care. I get suicidal thoughts at the end of the school day. I feel like I get stabbed in the back every time by my own mental health. But I have the bad attitude, I’m the “bad friend.” I can’t share this with anyone I know because they’ll just judge me or not care. I regret typing this and I won’t type anymore.",1
Another sleepless night.,"Another day goes by, and I find myself here in the middle of the night just wondering what went wrong. Life hasn't always been like this before, I remember back when I was a kid, back to a time when  I had so many friends and dreams, a time when I was so carefree and just happy. Now, things have changed greatly, and  I keep thinking and thinking about what led to this.

I've never felt this lonely and marginalised, I've lost the only few friends I had left about a year ago, I did my best to meet new people but always got ignored, as for my sentimental life, well, everyone I know has been in a relationship or had some kind of genuine connection with someone else, as for my part, I never had any gf, and whenever I tried I was either mocked or looked at with disdain, like I was disrespecting them because how could some miserable introverted loser like myself be interested in such an incredibly cool and compelling woman.

I feel so numb, I have no one to talk to, no one to open up to, nothing to do, which is why I'm on my own all the time even though I did my best to socialise with others. The thing is I don't bring anything to the table, my life is emptier than the void, and this is my sad reality.",1

Plus at work I'm distracted from all the sad thoughts and suicidal ideation but on weekends I'm alone with them. I'm honestly considering getting a weekend job so I can work everyday and distract myself. At least then I'll make more money and my depression will actually have an advantage.",1
Is therapy worth it?,"I find myself not wanting to tell anyone how I am feeling.

Whenever I tell my wife I'm down she says the I am the common denominator for all of the things that make me sad or depressed or stressed.

I've also just lost connection with most of my friends cause I never have time for anyone. And when I do have time I want to be selfish and have a moment to myself.

I've never really understood the appeal of therapy and having to pay for it bothers me as I don't like spending money.

Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder; Mild recurrent (whatever the word is) Hear me out...,"   If you try to think positive, you will start to be happy, depression may not go away, but I tried it myself and what the fuck, the thing I've been avoiding because of the situation I'm in or because I'm so comfortable being negative- this shit is changing my day. I started making an effort to listen to uplifting songs, think positively, without even having to try to smile more, I'm smiling and having fun when I go out.

Get this, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as well. I went from 'walking on the left side of the road' to dancing and laughing walking down the street but still kind of hiding the fact when cars pass by and getting back to it when they've passed. Don't try to be happy, try to think positively, be mindful of what you listen to (that shit affects you), and bathe in the sun (nude, dressed, whatever floats your boat).

Are your 20s supposed to be this lonely?,"I really don't have anyone other than my therapist that I can confide in to tell them how I truly feel. After some certain incidents, I feel exceptionally lonely & I am having passive suicidal thoughts. Honestly, I have been feeling this type of way since winter 2021. They say it gets better, but does it really? I'm still pretty sour about COVID happening because I blame that for ruining many things for myself & for others.

Ever since I was little, I could not wait to grow up & be able to do whatever I wanted to do, but I remember telling adults this at a young age & they would hit me back with, ""trust me, you don't want to grow up."" I remember passing those comments off as, ""whatever!"", but now I can see what they mean.

It doesn't help that I am also not great at maintaining friendships & relationships which also puts me in this pickle. At the moment, I would say I only have one ""reliable"" friend (note that the word ""reliable"" is in quotation marks because they really aren't *that* reliable, but they are one of the only friends I can shoot the shit with).

It doesn't help that my hobbies & interests are geared more towards the older community since I am trying to meet people closer to my age (I know that this comment sounds ageist & I have met great older people, but I do think it would be nice to meet others that are closer to my age). It also doesn't help that I am emotionally unavailable hence why another reason it is hard for me to maintain friendships & relationships or getting past the acquaintance level.

I really do question whether I am a good person because looking at others my age seems to be in great friendships & relationships & then I'm just trying to get by. I know that it's not good to compare yourself to others which is what I am exactly doing, but that doesn't mean that I'm not lonely. Overall, I just wanted to jot something down about how I am feeling since this is an anonymous community & I would appreciate the constructive criticism & feedback if possible. If you have gotten all the way towards the end of this post, I appreciate you & thank you for your time & consideration.",1
My Friend,"So, this is long and more on the story side of things but anyway. A friend of mine has been fighting depression for quite a while now. We've only been friends for a couple months but every night, her and I message until like 3 in the morning about her being depressed. Now I'm the 'therapist friend', I always have been, but its getting really hard, like every night I'm trying to convince her to keep fighting. She always says that I should just start ignoring her because she doesn't want to pull me down with her, and I've explained multiple times that the only way to not drag me down is to keep fighting and that we've passed the turning point, but she just won't listen. I don't know how or if I can keep helping her, I mean I own a small business with almost nonstop orders, I need sleep, but me helping her is preventing it. But I can't just stop, I'm not going to abandon her, me and another mutual friend have been helping for far too long to quit, idk what to do man, I'm sorry that this is a mess but its 1:19am, I'm tired, and I'm helping again.

One day I will beat depression.,"Life is a bit like an endgame boss, you really want to overcome and beat it, but it’s just too powerful and it keeps beating you, thus you have to keep replaying from your checkpoint, you try different tactics and different paths, but they all lead to the same place, you and the boss, alone…

Part of you wants to throw in the towel, stand down and give up, but if you do that, all of the work you put in to get to your checkpoint will be lost, there will be no starting over… so you keep at it, trying and trying… one day you’ll win it, right? One day we’ll get that achievement, get those trophies, reap the rewards… one day.",1

I want to disappear,"I’ve been depressed for a long time, but I’m just feeling the hopelessness now. I moved two states away from my home for a job that I feel trapped in (literally, because I’ll be forced to pay if I leave it) and lonely because I have no friends to share things with. 
It’s not surprising though. 

Im not conventionally attractive and Im quiet/shy with social anxiety. I don’t know what to say half the time so I don’t and then get sad when nobody talks to me. 

I honestly just feel like it would be best if I just work from home and stay inside all day. Then I won’t have to feel the sadness when I see people not even attempting to get to know me.. 

I wish I was different and I could live a normal life like everyone else I know. I can’t find anyone to be my friend, let alone date or marry me. Im going to be forever alone and I’m so sick of it all.

28F always depressed,"I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’m always fatigued and miserable. I’ve lost interest in my hobbies 10 years ago and now all I do is work and come home to relax or sleep. The only time I ever feel good and happy is when I smoke or trip which I rarely do anymore either cause it’s just an escape and not a solution. I started taking anti depressants recently but I feel as if nothing has changed. Often I wish I didn’t exist but I’m too chicken shit to commit. Although I hold a job that pays the bills it’s not fulfilling and I feel like I’m not fulfilling my purpose if I have one at all. And going back to school is a joke cause of how expensive it is. I never wanna do anything during my free time but scroll on my phone and lay in bed. Such a waste of time and space. Why does my brain do this to me.

i have done everything,Still i am not able to make her happy. Every time I broke her heart every time I made her cry every time she suffered because of me.But i did everything  to make her happy. I always did my best to prove my love for her and to prove that she is important for me.I accept that i have done many mistakes but i had already given apologies for that thousand times.But this time she wasnt happy with me and said some words that i cant take anymore i had already done everything to make things back to normal. But I don't know what she is thinking about me she was never like this before but she had become heartless so heartless that she is saying something that i can't take this anymore. I am not in a condition to handle more of her. And i want to end this suffering but I don't know what to do. I told her what I was going through because of the words she said to me. But she over did it she is not thinking about me anymore and she is hurting in every possible way. I have had enough. I'm in this for more than 5 days and everyday she is doing something that is hurting me more. I can't take it anymore. Want to die badly. I have even told her this. But she did what she wanted.,1

should I quit my job to focus on my mental health?,"Almost 22 and live with my parents. I've left home 3 times before each leading in failure due to my inability to keep down a job. Living at home while working and again my mental health is fucked and I feel I need to quit.

What I see the pros and cons are


**Pro quitting**


- I don't like working there
- It's a basic job with kinda low pay for where live.
- I'm so depressed I can't even keep up with basic hygiene (haven't washed my uniforms in over two weeks)
- can't keep a consistent sleep schedule because of depression. (also it's shift work so somedays I'm staring at 5am and others I'm finishing at 10pm.) It's 1:30am where I live and I start work at 5am tomorrow/today.
- I'm a bad employee. I'm frequently late to work, I put in minimum effort.
- suicidal while I'm in no way happy when I don't have work at least I don't feel like ending it.

**Anti quitting**


- I need to work to be a functioning member of society.
- I've tried quitting before and it hasn't worked
- I'm going to need money if I'm to leave home again.
- future Job market isn't looking great
- I planned to save up and travel. I likely won't be able to do that if I quit.


I've tried multiple antidepressants and spent way too much money on therapy but nothing seems to work. I've been of everything since the start of the year and it was going well but depression has reared its ugly head again and for the last 1-2 months I've been really struggling.

Been depressed since I was 15. Quitting has usually helped in the past but then reality sets in and I need to get a job again. I don't know what to do",1
I hate the way I am.,"I feel ugly, like a poorly drawn children’s portrait. My nose…protrudes. My skin ballsack-wrinkles around my eyes. My hairline is running away from my disgusting face.  My skin is the meaty red-pink skin of an Englishman, and it’s wrapped around the bone structure of an alien. My head is a large, odd shape, like a deflating balloon. I’m short, I sink below a crowd. You’d think that a guy like me must be clever, or sociable, or…something. This is not the case. I never could have imagined that anyone could be so talentless until I became the man I am.",1
Is there more to life than this?,"There’s got to be. I know this can’t be what living really is. I just feel like I am trying and trying and trying and nothings happening I am staying in place. I work so hard to save up money for rent and I just restart the next month. 

I recently had a traumatizing sexual experience happen to me and it feels like it’s pushed me back so much. I don’t want to think about it or deal with it it just feels like all my progress has been deleted and I am restarting. 

I feel like I am in purgatory. Nothing great nothing horrible. I don’t want to be ungrateful for the good things in my life but even when I am doing “happy” things I feel fucked in the head. 

I would never kill myself because of the people I love but I just keep thinking I cannot do another year of this. I don’t know how I will do it I don’t know how I will survive I am so unhappy

Mum would stay in bed and do nothing whereas me as a 5 year old was wondering around being unsupervised. Throughout school I’d never put my hand up as felt people would laugh at me. I felt the best option was to just be quiet and observe. I’ve always put myself down and hated the way I’ve looked because when I was a kid was being called Chucky. I hated presentations. People always laughed found me funny. Felt like an outcast , never truly knew who I was as a person. I feel useless. I felt like everything I’m doing is wrong. Not to mention home life was a mess from the environment being pure silence, and depressive that gets me deep into my feelings. Being picked on I know most people are bullied but I take it to heart.

How did I get myself here ? 

Like most people, I’ve had my fair share of misfortunes throughout my life. I’ve been clinically depressed for as long as I can remember. For years I’ve had to deal with my demons in silence until it completely got out of hand and I had to go into therapy.
At 17 years of age, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and I had to undergo chemotherapy and a couple of surgeries. It was just one of many life’s challenges that I’ve had to face and I’m okey with that. 

7 months ago, everything seemed to be looking up for me. I was newly dating my crush and we were extremely happy together. We both share the same desire to achieve a high level of excellence and we were motivated to put in the work as we were months away from getting our engineering degrees in our respective fields. As for my mental health, I was doing great as if my depression dissipated into thin air. I was extremely grateful for what I had, and all the pain that I had to endure in my life was finally worthwhile. 

Being deeply in love with each other, we wanted nothing more than to be together for the rest of our lives. And so, after a few months we decided to tell out parents. 
I suggested that I go first. I was nervous and terrified and I had no idea how it was gonna go but I was both surprised and thrilled by their reaction which ultimately encouraged my girlfriend to do the same as we hoped that it would be the same with her parents. It wasn’t. Her mother got mad at her and completely refused the idea of us being together mainly because she didn’t want her daughter to get engaged so soon (she’s 25 and I’m 27) and she wanted nothing to do with me because of my medical history even though I’m perfectly healthy now. 
It turns out that even though I made peace with what I went through early on in my life, it will haunt me for the rest of it. 
I asked for her mother to meet me, to get to know me a bit better and then decide. She refused and rejected me..
Me and my girlfriend stayed together for a few more months hoping that her mother will change her mind about me, until she was persuaded or rather threatened by her to leave me. 

It’s been a little over a month now, I’m still deeply in love with her and I’ve completely lost hope that things will get better for me. 
I no longer have any desire to live. I’m a few weeks away from getting my software engineering degree and I’m barely holding on just so that I can make my parents proud one last time.

I can no longer bear this pain.",1

30M Broken down and trapped,"First time ever posting something to Reddit so I hope I don’t break any rules. Apologies if I do. 

As the title pretty much says. I’ve been battling severe depression and anxiety for about 17-18 years now. Had good times, or at least, I had better times and I’ve had worse ones. But I’m reaching the point where I don’t have a lot left in me. I attempted college multiple times when I was younger and racked up an impressive amount of student debt without a degree to show for it. My wife got to her last semester of college and dropped out to care for her dying grandmother and then stayed out due to her own depression when her grandmother died. So we’re both drowning in student debt that can’t be bankrupted away. Our income potential is small and costs keep rising constantly. We get cancellation warnings from the power company monthly at this point. My health is slowly deteriorating a sliver at a time. I live in pain due to health issues I cannot afford to treat. My family is scattered across the CONUS so no support network there. I’m close to my breaking point and yet…
and yet…
I can’t break. 
I can’t afford to. I have two beautiful, wonderful, amazing children who love me. But all I can think  is that I can’t provide for them. But I can’t die either. Not just because financially they wouldn’t make it without me but I’m also aware enough to know that my death would devastate them. 
But even with that knowledge. Even with knowing that my life could be so much worse. Everyday is struggle to keep my head above water. To not display my anxieties to my children and have them grow up with a broken man as their father. But it’s so difficult. And so tiring. There is no one I can turn to. My wife has enough on her plate without me adding my struggles to it. Even my thoughts of suicide break me because I know I can’t do that to my family. I’m trapped in this breaking body and broken mind desperately searching for a way out even while I acknowledge I will likely never find one.",1
This might be obvious but,"I feel depressed because life has so much to offer but I don't really get to enjoy most of it. I just exist, get ignored and eventually experience an overwhelming death. I mean fuck, I didn't ask to be alive and live through this bullshit.

I have no idea what to do with my life at this point, I'm depressed af and it's a struggle to get out the bed because I'm reliving the SA over and over in my head.",1
Sigh,"It’s almost mind boggling how you can watch your mental health begin to rapidly deteriorate. At the beginning of this year I was relatively content with my life but ever since around April I feel like I have been spiraling into an abyss. For the past about 3 years I was living in a City about 3 hours from where I grew up. I told myself that a lot of the sadness that I was feeling was associated with the City I was living in and that returning to my hometown would alleviate some of the unhappiness. 

I moved back to my hometown in May and not only have these awful feelings not gone away, but they’ve intensified. I now realize that the “it’s not me, it’s the area” kept me going with something to look forward to as a solution to how I’ve been feeling. 

Instead what I’ve found in being here is that I am worn down by life’s responsibilities, by catering to the egos of my friends and family members, and that talking about how I feel with any of my friends makes me feel guilty because I don’t want them to feel responsible for my mental health. 

I’m losing interest in things that I typically enjoy, losing interest in my job that I’ve enjoyed for the past 6 years, and living day to day to just pass time. I feel like throughout my life I’ve been able to follow the typical life path: school -> college -> career, but never discovered a purpose along the way. If capitalism with vacations sprinkled in are all that I have to look forward to for the next 50 years, this is not an existence I want to participate in. 

Things appear to be ending with a woman this week that has completely captured my heart many, many years ago. Rationally, I think my feelings are being diminished and that I’m being emotionally manipulated, but irrationally thinking I’m very sad. Further, I don’t understand how everyone that I put so much energy into loving seemingly is capable of up and leaving without batting an eye. I feel like people take the best parts of what I have to offer and then leave when it’s no longer convenient for them. 

There is a subtle sense of shame I feel for even posting here, but it’s 3 AM and I cannot sleep and keep transitioning from being intensely sad to ok. I feel like there’s a ton that I should be grateful for but I cannot shake these desolate feelings. I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t have plans to realistically act on those feelings, but Jesus do I wish those feelings would go away.",1
My mental health just keeps getting worse this year,"2022 wasn't a very good start of the year for me as I heard the news of my uncle passing away suddenly, and aside from me feeling sad about his passing, I was horrified by how his death was only known around 2-3 days after he passed away as he lived alone, and the autopsy didn't even shed any light on the cause of his death.  That got my mind spiraling to so much negativity because 1) it made me think about how I have no social life and actual meaningful connections with people and fear I'm probably gonna end up dying like that too if I live long enough, that I'm just going to be fucking depressed forever and 2) I started fearing if my parents would pass away any moment now too, I really don't know what I'd do if I actually lived alone now because I'm such a mess. I'm pathetic. That got me feeling so awful for a solid few months... 

I haven't been talking to my online friends this year either because of all the negativity I've been withholding inside. Some of my so called friends shit on my current interests too so I felt like distancing myself from the group chat. I feel like it's so hard to reach out to people now. I feel like I've gotten worse at socializing. I remember I used to be so good at faking that stupidly cheery and positive vibe while online but now I'm just so sad and tired. I just want a genuine connection with someone. But I also feel bad if I had to make my friends listen to my dumb negativity.

I feel like shit at work too because I feel so incompetent. Compared to my peers who joined around the same time, I feel like I'm struggling so much. I thought I was getting a bit better now but there's a certain interview process that I need to pass (I'm just gonna be vague with this part) and my manager did a last mock interview with me which completely killed any little bit of confidence I had left. And now the actual interview is delayed, just when I was hoping to finally get it done and over it. I feel like maybe this isn't the job for me. And I kind of want to quit but I'm also worried about how it'll impact my future career paths because I've only been here for a year. I just don't know anymore... I don't even know what I'd like to do for a living. I've thought about monetizing my hobby but I just don't know if its viable.

Anyway if I talk about everything that's making me feel awful I'm probably never going to finish typing this post.

I just feel like I'm shit at everything, and I'm so lost. I've been crying a lot this year and having a lot of mental breakdowns too which isn't something that used to happen before.

"I want to fight, but I also don't want to fight","I'm not sure what to write now, because the title basically says it all.

I've been wallowing around in life in what seems like forever, I didn't get help as a teenager when it was offered to me, and I think I just continued on life thinking this was all there was to offer & I was just the same as everyone else.

I got married, and thought I was happy, but looking back I don't think I was, again I was just doing the same thing as everyone else around me.

A few more years later, and now with young kids, I still feel like I'm doing the same thing as people (and society as a whole) around me.

Many, many times I've tried to fight for myself, but life just drags me back to the status quo. I change for a week or two, maybe a month at most before going back to my old ways.

I want to fight even now, to find a better, improved version of myself, but I also just want to stop fighting altogether. To give up everything I have, let someone else have my life, have a life that I'm not grateful for, or anything else.

I'd be happy to give my life away to someone who would use it far better than I could, all because I want to fight, while not wanting to fight at the same time.",1

I am lost.,"Hi, I (23m) have never used reddit before and honestly don’t know what to say or how to express myself to strangers but here it goes. I am lost, I really don’t know my purpose anymore in this life. In the past 2 months, I have lost everything I worked hard to achieve. A healthy relationship, a good job, a good friend group, affordable housing, a reliable vehicle, and a stable mental state; all gone in the span of two weeks when it took me years to work for. It all started when I found out my girlfriend of almost three years cheated on me on four different occasions, all different guys, one of them i considered my best friend and another a minor i let stay with us because he had no where to live. Before this, my ex used my car the most and she has damaged this car that i have to still pay for. On a separate note, my ex has gotten many complaints called on my apartment (she wasn’t on the lease) to which after learning I was being cheated on, was given an eviction notice. Also I was left with the bill of $2000 for damages to the apartment she did and that i don’t have the money to pay off while she doesn’t have to pay a cent. Side note, she actually started dating the minor a couple weeks after we broke up so that’s fucked. I had to leave my job which actually paid good enough to get me by and it was a fun environment to work in. I had to move back home and a few weeks after moving back I got a dui charge and this pushed me over the edge of my mental health. Before the break up, I have had my share of depression and everything associated with it but having someone you loved and cared for help you through made it easier to live with it but knowing that basically all that love was fake and she didn’t seem to care made it so much worse after the break up. I feel back into my deep depression and I used alcohol to numb the pain and self harmed along with attempting suicide. for a awhile i was buying cases and opening it at night and drinking it till morning after it was gone. My nightmares, night terrors and sleep paralysis came back so i didn’t sleep no more. Everyday i woke up, i cried; cried at the reality that wasn’t good enough no more. But i’d keep repeating this everyday till i moved back home. Felt good being around family again; however, like mentioned before, i got a dui. My depression has reached the point where taking my own life is always on my mind and self harm has became a daily thing again. every emotion is nothing, im scared to feel again because it might be used against me like it it always has. I feel so numb and i want to leave this world but instead i’m stuck on a dark cloud of pain. Im so done and want to give up, this ain’t the life to live. im just.. tired",1
Wishful thinking,"I wish I was outgoing. I wish I was comfortable to be myself around people, even family. I have a bad habit of shutting down. I feel like I have an existential crisis Every. Single. Fucking. Day. It’s not supposed to be like this, I know. I’m not comfortable with myself. I self loathe, and it’s not passing me by. It’s like a shadow, always following me. I wish I had friends. How the fuck do I make friends as an adult?! Either I lose myself in work or not at all. I like working because then I don’t have to deal with family, or family events tbh. That’s literally the only reason I keep busy with work, at least I have a valid reason. Life is fucking exhausting. I don’t find joy in things anymore. It feel routine and bland. Why did I even wake up today? I don’t like being around a lot of people and avoid people, mostly family. I just wish I wasn’t born. Somebody else could take my place and live a life that’s worthy. Worthy of what? I don’t know. But not this, not the way I’m living it. Not the thoughts that go inside my head telling me I’ll never amount to anything, that cries at the drop of a pen, that wishes somebody would take this depression from my hands, cuz it’s unbearable and it’s getting hard to find things to cope with. I wanna live somewhere else, start somewhere new, but would that really fix my issues inside? I doubt that. I just hate myself so much. I’ve been trying to push it down, but I just drown in self loathing. I mean, this shit doesn’t get easier, does it? I guess I just hate myself too much. Thanks for reading, sorry if this is long.

I fucking hate depression and just want to be done fighting,"Depression is one mind fuck of an illness. It makes my head so clouded and foggy and I don’t want to do anything. I know that if I could get to the gym I’d feel better. But I just can’t do it. I can’t get myself there.

My meds were working pretty well for a while, I wasn’t by any means happy, but I wasn’t foggy every day. Then I decided to start working out, but like everything in my life, I gave up after 3 or 4 weeks. I guess that fucked with my brain chemistry and now I’m worse then before. Just made an appointment with my psychiatrist to try to get on some new meds, but that isn’t until Friday and then it will take a while to start working, if it even does. I don’t know what I’m gonna do until then.

I’m so ready to be done fighting. I know that I’ll have to for the rest of my life because my parents and grandparents still are. I really just want to give up sometimes..",1

I cannot stop thinking how this happened, I know I deserve better. But she remains so burned into my mind two months later. I can't forget her no matter what I do.

My worst day in years.,"My worst day in years...

I lost my dog today... she got sick suddenly and then we took her to the vet. We had to decide whether we wanted to try and force her to recuperate, which she might not... or whether we let her go. Chose the last one and let her die painlessly instead of a recuperation that she could have not handled. She was 14. So... odds were that she might not have long...

Last I saw of her was her in a table and in need for breathing tools so she could breathe. I couldn't bear to see her die. See the drug kill her. So I had to wait outside. 

Took her little body to my uncle's house, while he and his family (lucky them, he can afford it) stayed back in his apartment.

Being the city a mess, it took us far too long and his gardener (lucky him, again) had already left. We had to wait 8 hours for him to come back - in a dark, cold street... were people have been mugged before... just so we could bury my little one.

My uncle would call ever so often - with snide, indifference and antipathy in his voice. Upset we got there late.... and then he was annoyed when I refused to give my dead dog to an stranger so they could bury her ""later"". The very same indifference that I have been subjected to all my childhood from that side of the family. That antipathy which has hurt me so much and for so long... 

A conversation I never have with any of them - because I expect they would deny, deflect and argue back. It's happened before with less...

Am so pissed at my uncle right now. So angry... I've been my family's black sheep for being an Asperger. All my life. According to my mother, my aunt has at least once asked my cousin, a psychologist, while I was not present to give an input on how to, it seems, fix me. Or at least fix what she sees as problems.

I've heard my aunt and uncle demean me and my decisions for years. Accuse me of lack of understanding of people, using the Asperger as a justification to make it seem like I am incompetent of understanding others... which they have said to my face actually... that because I have Asperger I can't understand people.

Which is just rich. From people who seem to have no idea of the concept of empathy even when an innocent dead dog is concerned...

And the worst part is being alone for all of this. I have no friends left. People ghost me. All the time. 

They stop talking, make promises when they see me... never follow through. They speak to me a week then stop entirely... and never answer again... we make plans, never come through for them - don't send a message, don't answer calls. 

For years I have wondered what I do to become someone so boring that people want nothing to do with me. Figure it's because of who I am. What I like. Which my family doesn't care for, nor do they want to know.

My last friendship was a probably undiagnosed Borderline personality disorder and extremely toxic.

And I got diagnosed with depression and has still been unable to wean out the antidepressants... not ready, it seems...

Like my father probably is too. Because this Asperger 'who cannot understand people', Majored in... Psychology. 

Am so lonely. And I guess am gonna need pills to go to bed, tonight. And maybe tomorrow...",1

Close to giving up.,"Just a rant but I have no one else to talk to. Im not even sure what I need to do to feel happy. Ive joined therapy, workout consistently, have hobbies and have friends. None of it seems to be working, and I slip further and further into my depression. This past year has been extremely turbulent, had to leave a relationship of 7 years because it was toxic and I feel as if my friends dont care about me. I was going to really explain myself to my therapist but they couldnt show up to my session. It all just feels like its crashing down. Yesterday i got into a fight with my best friend over sexual harassment I experienced recently. Long story short they didnt seem to care and not willing to listen to me because of intrest in the harasser. Just adds to my perpetual feeling of not mattering to a single person. I dont want to give up but everyday that comes foward is a new issue and new disappointment. I try to stay positive but it is so hard when everything coming at me is negative.",1
I was recorded in the school toilets," 

Hi my name is Riley, today I've been struggling with a lot because I have to go for a meeting at my old secondary school which I had left a year ago now to move onto college, reason being I'm finally taking action for what of a shit school it is.

May 2018

I was in year 8 which in case you do not know what that means, I was 13. Like everyone else that's when I started puberty and I started to have new feelings and that's when I started doing something called masturbating. One day me being a stupid teenager, after school I went to the school toilets to go to the toilet and then I started feeling horny so I went and masturbated quietly. That's when these guys which were the highest year (year 11. 15/16 yrs old) came into the toilets and although I was quiet, I did not hear them come in and one of the guys went to the toilet stall next to me and put their phone above the stall to record me masturbating. I was not aware until I heard a bunch of guys screaming and laughing while running out of the toilets. I didn't know what to think, of course I was scared but I thought it was going to be alright because I didn't know those people right?

Well, the next day I got ready for school as usual then got to school and started to walk towards inside the school listening to music with my earphones, then as soon as I got inside these 3 guys came to me and one of them grabbing my bag to stop me from moving. One of the guys was shoving their phone in my face with a video of me in the school toilets, I did not get a good look of the video but I could tell it was me. Then a teacher quickly stopped them and instead making sure I was okay she just left afterwards. then I just looked around and literally EVERYONE was looking at me. I have never felt so observed and self conscious in my entire life. I tried to act like I had no idea what was going on but all of my school friends just came up to me laughing about it and I tried lying to them that it wasn't me but I'm pretty sure they did not believe it. I went to go to tutor and as I was lining up I was getting harassed non stop, and one of the guys from my year who is known for being a cunt just wouldn't leave me alone and kept calling me a paedophile and kept questioning why I would ever touch myself like that, and calling me disgusting, like I was not human because I masturbated. 

This continued for a good 5 minutes until the teacher came and let us in and thank fucking god that twat wasn't in my tutor. I was already a quiet kid that no one had knew about before the video but this time I was just dead silent and avoided any eye contact. After tutor I went on my way to the 1st period which was speech and language, and when I was nearly to my class one of my school friends saw me and reassured me that the video was everywhere! and that everyone has seen it! while smirking. seconds after the teacher came and I just busted out crying, having a mental breakdown in front of several people, then I was brought to some special needs room and the woman was playing some video on youtube on the computer with calm music which filled the room and it made me feel a little better, the woman then slowly started asking me questions which I was so hesitant that she didn't really get anything out of me, I just asked her to let me talk to my mum on the phone because I refused to tell anyone else about it then she did.

She left the room and my mum forced it out of me to say what happened. My mum came and we went home. There's too much detail that I really don't feel like explaining right now because I feel depressed right now and even was suicidal earlier but no fucking way am I not going to share my stories of how shit this school was. Yes I know I haven't said much about the school itself yet but another thing about me is that I am diagnosed with Autism which made this situation much worse because one of the things I have that came with my Autism is Anxiety. I am currently in therapy, and I'm starting to try and move past this. When this happened to me I would remain at that school for the next 3 years and I was verbally bullied at least a few times a week even at the very last week before we had left for college. I literally made no other friends because everyone assumed I was a creep. 

Even though its been a year since I've been to that school I still get flash backs at night which makes me so angry that it even makes me want to kill the people who did that to me sometimes. I've made friends at college who are girls and they're lovely but I still get those old thoughts thinking that they think I'm a creep and a paedophile and it has caused me to block them a few times because I didn't want to bother them. luckily I'm still friends with them now and I've even told one of them about what happened to me. I May or may not discuss the other things that happened to me at that school, it depends, but this being the worst thing I couldn't help but want people to listen to it and realise that, you are stronger than you think. I'm shocked that I'm still alive.",1
survival mode *on*,"
I learned to run on hate instead of love, thinking warm and calm is just no fun.  Everything needed to be exhilarating for me to accept, burning for me to touch and hurtful to keep me going. The problem is, as soon as I learned that I can indeed run on love, as soon as I discovered love to be a better feul then hate can ever be, as soon as I allowed myself to disarm for the first time, as soon is I put down my spear... I started craving for it, like never before. A dash of love has just taken apart my lifelong system. My body is craving with physical pain, cheels are running up and down my arms and back. I have to stop myself from begging for it, bargaining for it, asking for it. A dash of love ruined me more than it could ever save me and now if I do want to survive I have to put back on my armor of thorns that anchors itself into my skin just to make sure I'm bleeding just enough to stay numb. Hate is so empty now, I'll never be able to run on it again. But what's the alternative? Love?",1
I don't know why I'm here,"Another sleepless night on a giant rock floating aimless through space. The intrusive thoughts I get at night are just, yeah real shit. I've given myself purpose and meaning through a career goal I believe in. I have connections with friends, people who love and care for me. I have hobbies, things to look forward to. And yet, I am plagued by this emptiness. I feel so incredibly alone to the point where I am overwhelmed. Sometimes I get an explosive headache where I am convinced I will die, that the fear and loneliness will quite literally kill me. This is rare, and is often triggered by something each time it does happen, a piece of me is lost. How much before I'm gone?",1
Isn’t it weird,"That everyone seemed to love the joker movie but in real life it’s better you stay depressed because if they realised the joke was you they’ed hate it. Once more they’ll entirely forget they made you the joke in the first place... “ lol “ just food for thought, hope no one took this too serious 🦇",1
What do you do when escapism stops working,I feel like the only times I am not thinking negatively is when I am abusing escapism like hardcore playing games. I usually do it to the detriment of my other responsibilities but even when I do that at some point its not enough and I don't know what to do then. Right now I feel that way I usually would just play a game or watch something but it just feels like so much work now.,1
It’s all my fault,"This is just a vent so skip if you want.  I feel so guilty for everything. I am such a shitty person, I somehow always manage to push everyone away, whether I want to or not. I am a terrible son, I don’t feel like I’m making anyone proud, I am nothing more than a disappointment to everyone I know. I don’t have any real friends anymore. I wish I had the guts to kill myself, because atleast then i would do something beneficial to everybody. I have so many regrets compared to good experiences, or maybe my brain just clogs out the good things. I don’t know. Everyone always makes fun of me at school, whether they mean it or not, i don’t know. I’ve been called ugly In public by so many people that at this point it’s fucking unbelievable. Whenever I try to fucking talk to someone they never help, they just make me feel like I’m victimizing myself, and I absolutely despise that feeling. I just wish it would all end already, my head has been thinking non stop about all these things that Im supposed to be worrying about, and I’ve got no one to talk to.  I been alone for so long that I’ve grown to like it. I hate how people can say such mindless things like, “ it will get better DONT worry! “ Fuck you. The reason why I’m so fucking anxious and depressed in the first place is because of the uncertainty of the future. I don’t want to grow up, I don’t want responsabilites, I find it so hard to have any motivation for anything productive, I doubt that I would be able to take care of myself, bills, food, work, and everything else that comes with adulthood. I just want to apologize to everyone that has ever met me because I know that I made them feel awkward, that they didnt like me, that they just wish that I would go away, that I’m ugly, that I’m disgusting, that I’m a loser. I don’t know what to do anymore, I just want someone to think that I’m not disgusting. I don’t care what else they think about me, as long as they just see me as a human being and not a huge bag of shit and disappointment. It’s all my fault, no one can convince me otherwise, but I’d atleast wish I could do something about that other than hopelessly sulking in my own misery all the time. Very conversation I start feels forced, I can feel the way that the other person doesn’t want to talk to me and is either doing so out of pity or out of politeness. I just want it all to end. I just want to end it all.",1
Coping,"So I made an effort today to go watch a movie, all by myself and I felt good but sadly once the movie ends, reality of life started kicking in. Especially nights are extremely depressing and lonely smh",1
I've felt this way for so long that I don't remember ever feeling different. [RANT],"I'm not sure if this type of post will be allowed here, but if so, here goes. (NSFW tag for mention of sewerslide)

I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and a generalized anxiety disorder in my freshman year of high school. I tried alternative ways before starting medications (no, I did not turn to alcohol or drugs, and my prayers go out to those who feel the need to). The medications helped for a bit: I no longer seriously thought about unaliving myself at any major inconvenience, but that was about it. I was still tired and unmotivated, I couldn't focus on one thing for more than 5 minutes at a time, it became a chore to learn rather than something I loved to do.

I lost interest in my video games and journaling, and leaving the house was also a chore. Taking care of myself was a battle. 

I tried different doses of medications and different medications in general, but none of them helped more than a little bit. Recently, one of my medications caused what my doctors *think* is an autoimmune response that has left me almost immobile. I made a post before this one describing a little what it's been like. I forgot to add to that post that because of my current condition, I can't participate in any of my favorite activities, like journaling or gaming because it uses too much of my little energy, and I have simply lost the interest/ focus for such things. 

I am currently off my meds, and have been for about a month as recommended by my psychiatrist. I'm afraid to try a new medication in case it makes my current condition worse. At the same time, I'm afraid my mental health will spiral into a hole I can't drag myself out of. I am seriously considering making an appointment with my therapist to discuss this with her, but sometimes I can't find the words.

Thank you for listening. 😊",1
Failure,"I’m 24 and I don’t have any skills or talents, nothing special about me, no friends/boyfriend. Sometimes i feel like I’m just destined to die and be alone. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I try to be a likable person but oh well.",1
I think I’m starting to give up,"At first, when going into my adult years, i was very ambitious and had big plans for myself, but now, I truly just want to move to a cheap small-town area, get high (not on that hard stuff), and be alone. I have always worried and stressed about living in my area where things cost too much (60k+ just to be able to live comfortably), but if you go cheaper you will end up in a bad area. So it’s either fine a good paying job I’m not happy to be in just to pay bills. So i want to move to a small town where i can financially stay a float. As well as be alone, I have always been an introvert and alone. I also don’t feel love anymore (on the receiving end), so i don’t require a girlfriend or significant other(just someone to get my rocks off).

I just want to get a job working with animals or doing something in nature (with me living in cheap area, i don’t have to stress about the job paying me much). Have a decent apartment in a nice small beautiful town.

This is truly how i want to spend my final months or years before i decide it’s time for me to “let it all go”

Thank you for listening, hopefully some might feel the same way (whether it’s fully or to an extent) and not feel alone as far as feeling this way.",1
My fiancé died by cancer,"Hi there. It’s my first reddit message. 
My fiancé died 2 months ago. She had sarcoma. I don’t know what to do and just feel that I need to talk to somebody, tell the story about the pain that I felt by loosing her. 
In December 2020 she get the diagnosis alveolar rabdomiosarcoma 4th stage (the most rare type of cancer in that age, she was 23). At that moment I didn’t even think that in only 1,5 year she’ll pass away. 
Within one year almost every day we fought with this bitch: chemotherapy, medicines, I gave her shots with different type of chemical connections that I even don’t remember the name. Every day I told her that I love her and we’ll make it through and will fight as much long as it will take. Everything get well, she almost bit the cancer. There was only one test to do to recognise that she’s fine and healthy. But….we received opposite result….All work that we put in this year was destroyed and thrown out into the trash. But we didn’t stop, we didn’t give up. We found doctor to make surgery. The most dangerous surgery to do because neoplasm was to close to her vertebrae and she could blood out during surgery. 
One day before surgery…we were ready…praying…finger crossed….The surgery was planned on 24th of February and then the worst scenario happened…24th of February Russia attacked Ukraine at 4:00 am….
Surgery was cancelled. Bombs was falling everywhere in Ukraine also in Kyiv where we were. In panic and fear I run to the hospital where she was. Picked her up, packed all stuff and just run to the first train away from that hell that was happening there. Solders and police that forces people to go inside bunker, air alarm, explosions. Fear that I felt there was the worst thing that I ever had.
Somehow we jump in the train and drive to her city.
After few days we found the way to hand her to Europe to continue treatment but without me (by the Ukrainian law man from 18 to 60 can’t go outside the country during war time). There was only her mom and little brother.
But treatment didn’t help. In 2 mouth she passed away…..
I still remember her voice and words that she told me last time before she left the country…at that moment I don’t even thought that I see her last time. 
I still remember last call before she died. She told me to be strong and continue to live my life, find new love….
This pain that I felt at the moment when I knew she passed away I can’t explain. I can’t forget her and almost every day I think about he. 
Why God took her from me? Why she deserves to die? Why she can’t live and be happy? Why good people must die at this young age but bad people leave longer?
Why!….why! …why!… For those questions I think there is no answer…and this uncertainty makes me feel painfully and depressed.
P.S. For those who want to say sorry for me just forget it. I don’t need sorries and regret. I just left my thoughts and pain here for those people who had the same feelings or stories to make them know that there are not alone.",1
Losing my mind," 

My life should be great, on paper. I'm 20 and a physics student at a great college. My grades are excellent, I have a awesome group of friends, I'm involved with groups on campus. My family is loving & we've never had to worry about money. I'm pretty athletic and a fairly attractive guy.

There's always been this feeling of isolation from the world though, like I'm different than everyone else, mentally that is. Everything I do I hyper-analyze, every conversation, every action I do. I decided to go to therapy Spring of 2021, but only had a few sessions before the schools year ended & my therapy stopped.

I worked at a golf course during the summer, and it was an incredibly toxic environment. My coworkers were mostly racist, misogynistic, and just not great people. I got into a pretty bad headspace and ended up spiraling one night. There were several times that I wanted to end my life, and holding pills in my hand I decided against it. It was only a few weeks until the start of the semester and I could push through until I got therapy again.

The morning of the first day I found out my best friend was missing. Long story short, we found out that he had decided to take his life. This was an outwardly loving, caring and incredible human being, and no one would have ever thought that he would choose to do that. He was the one I went to about my suicidal thoughts, and I got into an awful headspace. I wanted to end my life, and I couldn't see how I could ever live again.

So, I went to therapy. My session went really well, I benefited from talking through things with my therapist. I got diagnosed with bipolar syndrome by a psychiatrist & depression/anxiety by my therapist. But, it was fall of 2021 when I discovered weed. And since then, I've been addicted to being high. I've had stretches where I've gone sober, but never more than 1 or 2 weeks. It's a constant thought in the back of my head, always thinking about how my situation would be better if I just had weed.

No one knows this. I've lied to everyone in my life about how I'm doing. But I don't know how much longer I can keep the act up. There have been stretches where I've really taken care of myself and have been doing really well. Yet I always fall back down and it feels like an insurmountable hole that I can't dig out of.

I decided not to reread any of this, it's more of a train of consciousness. Who knows if it'll get replies, I just needed to write this down before I internally combust.",1
I hate myself right now,"I made a mistake and all I can do is beat myself up over it. I deserve it. I was stupid for doing it.  I only have myself to blame. Stupid, stupid, stupid.  That's what I am. Why do I do such dumb things?",1
I'm so tired of constantly letting people down,I wish I was a better person. I fail at my job. I fail at relationships.  I'm lazy. I'm just tired of doing the wrong thing.  All I can say is I'm sorry.,1
my life story and my political and unpolitical views on the world.,"this is going to be a long fucking post, people aren't probably going to read this. if some things don't make sense, i apologise cuz im writing this at 3:57 in the morning.

life story:

i'm 15, a male and i think i have depression. i've wanted to get help before, but the most i've ever done is go to the school counsellor and she did fuck all. also excuse me for my language in this. 

i want to get help but i don't want my mum to be there with me because she's the one that's put me in this mental state. let me explain.

my mum has been abusing me ever since i was about 7. it started with verbal and physical, and at about the age of 12 turned into mental. she stopped physically abusing me at around 10 years of age, albeit hitting me every so often. the verbal and mental abuse still persists to this day. the reason she abused me was because of this cycle. the cycle goes as such:
- i don't listen to my mum or do something that i wasn't supposed to do (keep in mind this is me at the age of 7ish)
-my mum tells me to listen to her or not do that thing again, 1zand i agree
-but me being the stupid dumbass of a 7 yr old continues to do those things
-this repeats 2-3 times until my mum has had enough and she then slaps me, verbally abuses me.
this cycle repeats but after my mum had started abusing me, she almost always includes violence and abuse.

personally i don't blame her for getting angry. but i think hitting your child every time u get angry is a bit over the top. i'll let u guys think of that. 

that cycle went on for roughly 5 years until one night i found myself hyperventilating with my hands in a preying position, with my head on the table and crying uncontrollably. i explained this cycle to my mum. she understood and we decided to try to fix this cycle. but it kept on persisting. the reason for this is because i lost all respect for my mum when she was hitting me and abusing me. i still remember on one of the nights she was cooking and she was trying to help me with my math homework. i was in year 2 or 3, i can't remember. i wasn't understanding what she was saying, and she got so angry at me that she held a knife up to my face. i don't remember what she was shouting at me but she was bloody fucking mad.

half-way through year 6, my dad left me, my younger sister who was 9 at the time and my mum. he said he left us for 'personal reasons', but the reality was he had an affair with this woman he had met on a dating app. she lived in america for fucks sake. (we live in australia) that shit really hurt, considering i liked him as a person, not a dad. he was never a father figure, and never will be. he never took me and my sister outside to play. he only did it once and it took my mum to tell him to take us outside. he never planned anything, it was always my mum. everytime i asked him if he wanted to play a game with me on the PS4, he always said 'no not today mate, maybe next time'. there never was a fucking nezt time.

before dad left, my mental health wasn't the best thanks to my mum. but when i moved to high school, my mental health plummeted. i thought of myself as a burden, as a waste of space, that people would be happy if i killed myself, thoughts like that. i still do get those thoughts.
i only talked about these problems to a select few friends. they didn't help much, but i didn't care. i just needed to get it out of me. 

over the years, my mental health got worse and worse. in year 8 i told my music teacher about some of my problems, which was only the abuse and suicidal thoughts. she told the principal as she was legally obliged to, and i got into counselling. she did fuck all lol, all she did was give me an app when i felt like i wanted to end it all. stupid fucking hag.

i've attempted suicide twice, both by me trying to choke myself. one was in year 8, one this year in year 9. first one was in the school bathrooms, second one was in my bedroom. both times i was crying and wanting to die so badly i actually tried choking myself to death. i passed out the first time, second time i let go before i passed out. personally i'd recommend using either a gun or just jumping off of a building.

i know that some of you guys will call me fake for what im about to say, but i've resorted to drugs when i feel like killing myself, or if i feel like shit in general. i vape and smoke tobacco. when i turn 18 and im mentally not in a good place, i'll try alcohol and see if it helps. i know it's not good for me but im desperate to try anything. 

i'm emotionally numb as fuck. there's this weight in my chest that doesn't allow emotion to escape, so every laugh is a fake one unless i find something generally funny. so my mood is basically if i smile or not. i can watch the most horrific shit and i feel nothing. i can hear the cries of a man cutting his hand off as a punishment of something and im not disturbed. i don't know what it's like to genuinely love somebody, only like them as a crush. i've done a bit of research, and maybe this is anhedonia? i'm not sure, but if anybody reading this has anhedonia could possibly tell me if i might have it?

i hate everything about myself, absolutely everything. im lanky, pale as fuck, have hairy legs, am ugly (in my eyes at least. all my mum's friends' say im handsome but i dont buy that shit), my hair is autistic (it's long and i tie i up in a ponytail but i have an undercut because my mum made me get one. i am currently in the process of growing it out), i have braces, i have bags under my eyes, my fingers are boney, etc etc. the only thing i probably like about myself is my voice and my eyes. my voice because it'a deep and my eyes plainly because i like the colour. amazingly, i've had 3 girlfriends. 2 irl and one online. i was really fucking dumb to online date, that didn't last even 1 month. the two others dumped me. one thought she didn't like me anymore and because my texts were dry, and the other because her mental health was getting worse when we were in the relationship. my love life is fucked. i genuinely liked the two irl gf's.

i am really self conscious. i stutter and slur my words a lot, and i am aware of it when im speaking to my friends and people. i couldn't even get two movie tickets for me and my third girlfriend. i got so nervous and i couldn't speak properly. 
i am acutely aware of every little thing i change about my appearance. for example, i'm out in public and i put my hood on for some personal space. immediately i start thinking 'do people think i'm a junky' 'am i dodgy like this' 'all these people must think i'm a dodgy teenager aye' etc etc. it fucking sucks.

polotical and unpolitical views on the world:

some of these might not fall under this heading, so i apologise if so.

for me, life is boring. this has nothing to do with all the problems i stated above. life is genuinely boring. i am expected to wake up, go to school, work hard for a good future, come home and then repeat that. repeat it for 13 years. i personally find it boring. i'm not saying u can't have fun during those 13 years of education, for me high school has been the best 3 years of my life so far. but i want some adrenaline, some fun and some thrill. so i resorted to graffiti. vandalism to me is a form of venting, of saying to the government 'fuck your laws', shit like that. i love graffiti, and nothing u guys will say will change that. i resorted to graffiti to vent, but also to for me to have fun. for me, it has to be illegal for it to be fun. i want to know that i'm breaking the law and that i'm not getting caught. that for me is fun. doing graffiti is like pointing a big fat middle finger to the authorities.

it's wierd, isn't it, that when someone famous dies, it's televised nationally and millions of people mourn. but when someone who isn't famous dies, the only people who mourn are the people who knew him and were close to him? lemme explain my point. 
recently technoblade died, and the minecraft and gaming community mourns his passing, and rightly so as he was well known. but if i died, like i said above, only people i know would mourn. but people say that everyone's life is worth the same, so wouldn't it be reasonable to nationally televise every death in australia or japan or whatever country you are in? maybe even internationalise it? like the people we do pay respects to our people we have lost close to us, and the soldiers of world war I and II. it's family, friends, famous people and people who have done big things that we mourn and remember. 
i know this is a stupid point but i just wanted to put it in so ignore it maybe

the australian government is so pathetic. they don't listem to their people when we told the government we don't want the fucking light rail. we got rid of them 100 years ago, we don't need them again. but they went ahead and wasted a couple billion dollars on this huge thing that they thought was gonna make a big difference. it was a flunk, nobody used it. they realised it was a flunk, so they got rid of (i think it was) 24 bus routes that were similar to the ones of the lightrail so we would use it. it's stupid honestly.


ok, well that's the end of that. if you've read everything, then thank you. if u read a bit and saw how much shit there was to read, still i thank you for clicking on this. this was one of my vents, goodness knows if i might come back and vent again. if there are a couple grammatical errors then i apologise. i'm not bothered to go through all this and check for any lol

anyway, have a good day/night, and i hope everything goes good for you :)",1
anyone who wants to talk,I dont have any drive these days to move forward in life. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. Incidents that happened over an year back still affect me and it plagues my mind. It was a bad relationship and infidelity was involved. I dont have anyone I can talk to about this. I find myself forgeting things and needing to put more effort to do basic tasks. I'm so tired. How does everyone deal with their thoughts when you're alone in your room. My lack of productivity is causing many opportunities to slip away. I dont want to live like this but I feel so defeated.,1
Struggling financially.,"I have no options left. I have tried applying for hundreds of jobs, not eligible for benefits, no family support, no parents, no friends, no savings, i have nothing. I am so fuckin low. I can’t even buy toilet roll. How is that possible? 23 years old and a student. No support out there for students and I’m desperate for a job!!! Tried surveying and it’s all scams. I’m so tired 😭",1
Hating my best friend,"I loved food, I loved everything about it. The way it tasted, the process of cooking it, how it made me feel. I would consider it my best friend cause it always made me happy. Then I was taunted by demons. Both internal and external, I was bullied because I was overweight and I hated my body because cloths wouldn’t fit. I hated the way I looked, I got self conscious. 
In due course I developed a bad relationship with food, I became bulimic. I have episodes of binging and purging, I starve myself sometimes and force myself to eat “healthy” food by which I mean low calorie and low nutritional diets. I used to overwork my body and the weight started cutting down. I received a lot of attention which I enjoyed at first, then it led me to become more self conscious and everytime I tried getting better, I relapsed. My habits always took over. Along with it my mental health started deteriorating. I was prescribed antidepressants and now, they don’t seem to work anymore. 
I wish my relationship with food wasn’t ruined because there is so much I want to try eating, cooking and enjoy. I want to live in the moment, at the same time I want to defeat my demons which seems impossible. 
I wish there was a way to tackle them to the point I emerge victorious (I have tried before and always failed). I know people say it’s all in the mind, but it’s hard to control and if you relate with what I’m going through (not the same situation perhaps but the feeling of not being in control of your mind) I sincerely wish you find a way out. It really sucks :(",1
Just venting,"Im not even sure if what is happening is normal. Do other people just crash like this sometimes?  My friend mentioned something about my past today innocently and how i used to just start crying in public. It was to say that im a lot less anxious now but it just made me think about what happened and i just fell into sadness. Some time later when i was home alone i just couldnt do anything but lay down and scroll on my phone untill i just started crying.
This is not the first time this happened. Just thinking about it after two or more years still sends me into a spiral that ends in crying.
Im a lot better now... i feel happy a lot of the time, i dont lose myself in my thoughts anymore and have had no panic attacs. 

Really reading this youd think that i had gone trough something truly horrible but it was more of me realizing all of my convictions about the world were wrong. I was overworked, stressed, close to no social life and believing if i just worked hard enough and helped as many people as i was able to it would all be ok in the end. In the end i was all alone again and not only that but the people i was helping were making fun of me behind my back. This would escalate in the end giving a final blow to a very difficult few years sending me deep into depression.

As i said, its been slowly getting better for the past year but i still fall into this locked-in state and just lay there and sometimes cry... 

I just struggle to get over it. Ive ""forgiven"" the participants but the fact it happened still hurts me in ways nobody can really understand. I feel like i cant talk to my friends anymore because i should have gotten over this by now. I dont think theyll ever really understand why this hurt me so much.

Mostly i just feel hearbroken that the world and its people arent as good as i thought theyd be. We pretend were soo liberal but as soon as we see somebody suffering we use their symptoms as jokes.",1
I’m starting to think that I’ve started to loose my mind.,"For some reason I feel dumber. Sometimes I phase out, I have difficulty remembering simple words. Sometimes I even have problems speaking simple sentences. Even though this doesn’t happen regularly, it happens from time to time. I’ve got no friends, no one to speak about this too. I dunno if there is therapy near me. I dunno what problem I have. I’m still not ready to open up about this. But I’d to speak anonymously about this. Sometimes I think making myself believe i have some kind of problem or acting up. I do have anxiety issues. I dunno if I have some mental health issue. But I’d like some help, if people can.",1
"many contacts, no friends","When I feel a certain way, sometimes I want to share it. Tell someone, laugh about it, cry about it, be angry or greatful together.
I then look around me only to be reminded that I'm completely alone. I tap on my messeging app just to scroll through my last conversations, thinking who can I tell that'll read the whole messege AND react. Too often I stare at my contact list for a short minute knowing none of these people will. They won't read and if they do they'll just text back ""cool"" in like 2 hours. I then put my phone down, put half a sad smile on my face and tell myself.",1
Either overdramatic or depressed,"Not sure who will read this, but this is a long one: 

Throwaway account to just post how I actually feel inside. I don’t know, I feel like I  don’t have anyone to talk with. I tried a therapist. TBH, I am broke and I don’t want anyone to know that I am depressed. 
Idk what the fudge I am. Lonely? Depressed? Just sad? Or just fudging dramatic. 

I have some terrible past history, which sort of makes me who I am today. I am a talkative person, but only one person knows everything, and that’s my husband. Not everyone knows every bad thing that has happened to me. 

Even though my husband knows everything. He doesn’t have a clue what I am thinking half the time. I am sort of a submissive person, my husband yells when I don’t go with what he says; nothing abusive, just simple stuff. 

Like, he will ask me or tell me something. And I am in my cloud of thoughts. So I ask him I didn’t get what he said, this has happened quite a few times. Now he just yells, and to me; he always seems to have a bad temper. Today we had an argument, and he said how his relationship with his parents has become sour because of me, and that when he asks me to do something that means he has already thought about it, and he thinks I can do that.

So now, I feel like everything’s my fault. And I shouldn’t be in his life or anyone’s really (because none of my relationships end on a good note). I should just distance myself and stay forever. 

Idk if this post makes any sense. But I am willing to share or clarify.",1
I have to ask,"I have a condition that, without getting into gross details, makes me throw up and hurt nearly every day. Sometimes it lasts for a week or more with no let up. The person who actually made me want to keep going died well before his time just as the light started shining at the end of a very long tunnel. I even got a dog for something outside of myself to care about. So my question is, is there an actual point? What reward to we get or give that is worth a lifetime of pain and suffering? It's it worth it to force myself to keep going? Why?",1
Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn gets me through some really tough times,Anything she's in helps me but her as Harley Quinn has helped me through some terrible urges and I'm still clean from cutting and sober from alcohol with her help.

not feeling worth anything,My girlfriend has been mentally abusing me. I don't know how to deal with it. I feel weak and ineffective. I want to be loved desperately and can't seem to get it. I hate myself everyday for it. I hate that I'm not able to feel love. I'm constantly giving and not receiving anything in return. I don't know what the point of this is anyway. It's not like anyone cares.,1
Just getting some things off my chest.,"Hi all, as the title suggests I’m just wanting to get a few things out in the open. I’m not after support and messages at this time as I know there are poor souls out there worse off than me that need the help and I hope they get it. I’m just stuck in a rut. I feel down and out, I feel alone and I’m exhausted of keeping a normal appearance to my friends and family in fear the truth would crush them. Some days are worse than others (that I’m sure everyone goes through) and I’ve only been able to rely on myself in the past and I trust myself to get through the issues I have. My stubbornness hates the thought of pushing my problems onto others and that’s probably why I keep everything bottled up and to myself. I’m sure I’m not the only person who is like this but if it gives anyone else a feeling that they are alone, I hope it helps them realise that there are others out there who worry about the feelings of their close ones and others other than the feelings of themselves. I guess the mentality of this post is for self healing and perhaps to give help towards others? It’s long winded but I’m just speaking my mind.",1
My life is going down hill and I’m only 13,"I’m 13 and my lonely. Very lonely. I haven’t been to regular school in 3 years and I probably won’t be able to go again this year. I have no friends, girlfriend or anyone to talk to. Friends who I’ve had over the months/years have betrayed my trust. They’ve called my names that I choose not to repeat. And other things. I sometimes wanna end it all. 

I’ve been through so much the past 3-4 years. No one understands or cares. I have no one. Even the dreams I’ve had of becoming a singer, dancer, game developer and more have gone down the hill. I’ve been told I’ll never make it. I’ve been told so much shit. 

I’ve never had a real girlfriend. Girls who I’ve dated have either broken up with me the same day or broken up within 2-3 days or have cheated on me. I’ve been bullied my entire life. And no one cares. I’ve even lost the relationship I’ve had with God (Jesus Christ). I’ve been depressed. I’ve said I was gonna run away and never did.

I’ve wanted to so many times. I even planned and never did it. I have a bit of a weak heart so I don’t think I could last. I just want at least one person to give a shit about me before I leave this world….",1
I just wish I could dissappear,I'm so depressed because I'm so lonely all I want is to have someone I could hold in my arms and as she looks back at me she smiles because she is happy to be with me but I'm sure I'll never get to know what that's like it sucks being autistic 34 and single my whole life I just want to know what it's like to have a girlfriend but I guess the universe said no I just want the pain of feeling so sad and hopeless to go away well I'm sorry if I made anyone feel sad by reading this I really do hope everyone has an amazing evening please everyone stay awesome and thank you for taking the time to read this,1
I hate my body and how I look.,"I'm way overweight, I'm extremely fat, and I feel guilty and mad at myself when I see other people that have their bodies in good shape.

I've tried to exercise before, but I'd give up after the first few days.

I don't go out much, but one day I chose to walk to the park to get some fresh air, when I was leaving I heard some people behind me call me a fatass.

It hurt.

Why does it have to be so difficult to lose weight and all the stuff that comes with it like maintaining a healthy diet, and sticking to it?

Why couldn't I've just been given the gift of not being a fat fuck?

I am so fucking confused and exhausted.,"I am so fucking confused. 

Every time I think I’ve reached some sort of epiphany about life and have finally reached happiness, I keep coming back into this same hole of loneliness and absolute despair. It’s so god damn annoying having these waves because they don’t come and go weeks apart but hours. For consecutive days I’ll feel content with life and all of a sudden a thought hits and I don’t think I’ll be alive within the next two hours. Then an hour will pass and I’ll forget I even thought such a thing, then see a building and think about how nice it’d be to fall out of existence, literally. It’s exhausting. I’m exhausted.",1

I see no way forward.,"I'm freaking out right now due to my new job with an incredible fear of getting fired.  Having just completed my civil engineering degree last year at 35 guy I got a new job I'm trying to make work and spend hours trying to make it work outside of paid work.  I've been there six months and I cannot do the job.  I'm just too useless, idiotic, moronic, incompetent or some other synonym to describe my lack of ability in the new job, regardless as to ask.  It could be something seemingly easy or more complicated.  Just assume that anything I'm asked to do, I am incompetent of doing it successfully.  The actual examples are too numerous to post here.

I have a history of telling myself how useless and incompetent I am.  Proof is in the pudding as, when it comes to paid work, I am useless and incompetent.  It is pointless telling myself or convincing myself of anything different, other than being useless as I have literally always thought this way about myself.  It resulted in doing poorly in school, not making any friends and constant bullying from teachers but mainly peers.

When I try to discuss this with my mother, she just makes me mad by turning it around to say I'm blaming her for how I'm feeling and how I blame her for any number of things.  It just makes me mad talking her, and she tells me how it is better I'm mad than still thinking about my job and what is going wrong with it.

I cannot ask my girlfriend (fiancé) for help and support as I act as her rock, but that is not mutual.

It is impossible for me to make the time or have the ability to see anyone professionally about how to cope with the way I constantly feel about myself and everything I do, my job being the latest casualty.  On top of which I could not afford it.  Please don't suggest I am on the autism spectrum (I would not get tested anyway) from posting this here as I'm not and even if I were, I would consider that a bad thing and detriment for my own career goals.

I have no idea what to do at this point.  Every job I have literally ever had has always caused this much anxiety.  What do I do?",1
Feeling completely worthless,"Thought I was making the right move a few months ago and make a career change. To save time, it didn’t work out and we’re sinking financially. I’ve been trying to make it work and while the prospects come in slowly, I’ve put my family behind on bills. And to top it off, at the worst possible time, our landlord is raising our rent $700 due to “that’s where the market is now”. My landlord is a Pharmacist and his wife is a physician. 🙄

I’ve been DoorDashing at night while trying to make my business work and also applying to jobs to get back in Corporate America.

What pushed me over the edge was yesterday when I took my 11 year old son fishing. We weren’t having any luck out there and my son says to me, “daddy, when you have money, can we get minnows next time?”. He wasn’t being mean or disrespectful, was just being honest. It took everything in me to not just break down right then and there. 

I feel so fucking worthless. It takes everything in me just to get out of bed and my overall outlook in life is bleak at best. I have to hurry and pop my ADHD medicine in the morning so I can get to that high the magic pill takes me to so I can function. 

I hate this. I know my wife is losing patience in me even if she doesn’t say it. I have a beautiful family to live for and that is all the motivation in the world but I can’t shake this imposter-syndrome, worthless, lazy sack of shit feeling. Pray for me y’all. Thank you",1
I wonder if people would read it.,"For the past 15 mins, I have been reading posts by people who are struggling with depression, and I feel strangely relieved knowing that I am not alone. Maybe it's the hope that someone would be able to relate to how I feel.

Life feels stagnant, like it's been stuck in the same place for so many years now. I try to do things, something that'd make me feel I am moving, like I am growing, but I always end up leaving it halfway and ending up feeling miserable thinking I can't do anything at all.

It's like standing all alone in a railway station and watching the train pass. You see the people on the train going on with their lives. You want to board the train and get out of that damned deserted lonely station but you can't move your feet. You just can't. It is as if you are shackled in thick, invisible chains that won't let you move. Noone can see them, but you know they are there.

I feel like a shell - lifeless, empty, drained, like somebody hollowed the whole life out of me.

I tried to do something about it but things never worked out. I started despising the very idea of hope. I am not sure how I feel about that now. Life's still stuck. I am still standing at the station, trying hard to will myself to board the next train. I am not certain if I'd be able to do it now. But I think I'd keep trying.

It'd be sad if I do not do anything to stop life from slipping away.",1
what is the purpose of life?,"Why do we live our life the way we do?
Why do we set aspirations and run after them if our ultimate destination is death?
Why do we dream, and chase our dream if we cannot catch it, or even if we do, it won't last forever?

What actually is the purpose of life?",1

I think I’m depressed again and Idk what to do,"I was depressed from September 2021-April 2022. I always knew I would get depressed at some point because my mom was medically diagnosed with depression,anxiety and insomnia. My granddad attempted suicide before my mom was born and he was a drug addict and he was anorexic at some point. My great grandma killed herself also and the list goes on. My depression started off with me failing one of my classes on the progress report. I had so much built up anger against my stepdad,And I had so much sadness from my aunts murder and one of my childhood friends also died which hurt a lot. I had already been having suicidal thoughts because I felt as if I had no purpose and I was worthless. But now I felt stupid and felt as if the future I had planned for myself was never going to happen. All the verbal abuse from my stepdad and me feeling as if I had no escape all came out.To sum it all up during that time I pushed everyone away and I pretty much stayed alone. With the help of a therapist and I started taking care of myself better I somehow got over it.

About 2 days ago I was looking at my aunts obituary I just started randomly crying which I know probably makes sense but I haven’t cried over my aunts death in awhile and it was just random. I also had a full on breakdown in the shower and I honestly don’t know why. I have lost about 12 pounds and I don’t even work out and I’m already skinny. Normally I gain weight during the Summer but I’m losing weight. I do still eat but like I just don’t eat a lot and maybe that could be a reason. I also have been realizing that weed is the only way for me to stay happy, when I don’t smoke weed I get really anxious and I can’t explain the feeling of it I just don’t feel normal when I don’t smoke. My parents told me we are going to visit family tomorrow and usually I’d be happy to go out of state but when they told me I honestly didn’t care at all. I don’t feel depressed but a lot of the signs are there and I’m just worried it’s back.",1
My story,"I have a habit of checking my weight every day and I haven’t purged in the last two days, so obviously my weight increased. I was obese my whole life and during the 2021 lockdown, I became bulimic and lost tons of weight. Now everytime I check my weight I feel horrible because I’ve gained quite some of it back. I tried changing my habits but keep reverting back to purging. I know it’s not healthy but it’s taking a heavy toll on my mental health. I fear all my clothes are going to get tight and my face which had defined structure is slowly fading. I wish I could stop this habit  because everytime I try to build a better relationship with food, it all goes downhill. I’m extremely tired of the stress it’s causing me mentally and physically.",1
I just hate being me anymore...,"I've never posted my feelings for complete strangers to see, but I don't have any other outlet anymore and I'm hitting my breaking point again.
I feel so fucking alone and broken. Relationships don't last, my ""friends"" have all just vanished and I feel like I'm the one having to put the effort in even with my past. I have no family and the ones I do have...whole different story.
I turn to showing off on reddit for attention, got heavy on drinking and doing extra curricular activities to cope anymore and I'm just....lost. Putting on a fake smile for work and life just is getting too exhausting and I don't know how much more I can stand",1
"I think I can't go on anymore, I can't take it anymore.","I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore, I lost everything, everything that gave me that bit of happiness ľI lost.

these are my last words, i think i'll be done with it soon.
sorry if i wasted your time reading this.",1
coping mechanisms aren’t working,"
disassociating and disconnecting makes me feel sick to my stomach. i catch myself slipping deeper into the darkness every day. i struggle to hold conversations, i’m finding it extremely hard to do the basics, i feel numb. 

i sleep for 2-3 hours at a time, i can’t finish a meal, i can’t focus on music or a podcast, my coping mechanisms feel like they’re not working. 

my body is beginning to feel the ache of the emptiness inside me.",1
My depression is worse now that I've left uni,"Hi all,
My first time on this subreddit and just kinda wanted to word vomit. So I've suffered with depression since I was a teenager but I know how to manage it and I honestly was doing okay during my last year of uni. But... I recently finished university, and I feel like I'm spiralling again.
I'm no longer near any of my friends (I live in a very small and shitty town) my support system is gone and I can't afford my therapist anymore.

Of course I can still video call people but I think covid has proven to us that that does not help with the loneliness.

My family are fine for the most part but I can't talk to them about any of this, they try their best but they're just a bit shit with dealing with my depression (and it doesn't help since I suck at explaining how I feel)

I feel lost mostly. And I miss my friends so much, I didn't realise how much they made me forget about my depression until now.

But yeah, I just needed to get that out there since online is my only venting place now really.",1
I'm just so tired.,"I feel like every decision I make is wrong and everything I touch turns to crap. I feel crushed by the weight of my responsibilities to my wife, my children, and my job. Nothing in my life brings me any joy. I feel trapped in my life. I definitely understand how people get to the point of ending everything.

I have felt this way for as long as I can remember.

I know it is selfish and unappreciative of my life but I pray most nights that I won't wake up in the morning. I carry enough life insurance that I know my family will be ok. Probably better than ok. Better than living with me and my mountain of failures.

Not going to kill myself or anything. As much as I hate it, I am my family's only income and I can't leave my children with nothing and no way to take care of themselves.

Just wanted to whisper my pain into the ether I guess. Thanks for listening.",1
Loving myself,"Today, I set a new goal that is to take care of my body as if it were another person. I ate mostly healthy food, I gave myself some rest and most importantly I did not criticise my body. She is beautiful, she has faced so many struggles and is still going strong. I’m thankful for a body that takes care of me and hasn’t given up inspite of all the hardships she’s faced, ( I’m referring to my body as a woman because let’s face it, they are AMAZING.)",1
afraid to sleep,"I avoid sleep sometimes due to a fear of waking up the next morning. It's like I know that going to sleep means that tomorrow comes. I am a deeply anxious person, and this has led me to retreat into my room. My room is my safe place, but when I spend too much time in it I stop taking care of myself. I only eat junk, forget to shower, don't change the sheets or even fix them when they become un-tucked and a tangled mess. I have become very tired.",1
"everything that makes me happy, disappears","I feel like absolutely everything that makes me happy just get ruined, or stopped, or disappeared, for no valid reason or explanation, I don't know where to put this so I thought maybe r/depression, and I can't really ask anyone irl

It goes for super small stuff that don't really matter and It'd sound like I'm being extra but it's just hard to explain, like from internet cut outs, an app not working properly for no good reason..to actual problems I'm having in my life

There was a girl I met a few months ago, things were going really great between (she's my first relationship-ish), I don't know about her but she made me smile, I liked her company, she made me feel worth it and feel that somebody cares, she made take care of myself and so forth, the day we confessed over text, (she confessed first) I was the happiest man in the world, and judging of her voice in the voice notes she sent me, she was happy too, we kept chatting for a while then we had to sleep, 

The very next day, she sounded different, like someone else entirely, she was cold and kept replying with ""yes"" ""sure"" ""no"" ""I know"" ""ok"" stuff like that, then things went super south and we didn't speak again (that's a different story and I don't know if I wanna go through it now)

You see, it feels like everytime the universe sees me happy or finding that my awake time is actually better than my sleep, it destroys everything, do I not deserve to be happy?

I started to get ridiculous thoughts like maybe someone put a curse on me or something (I don't really believe in that stuff but it seriously is the only thing that makes sense)

One thing to mention, is the timing, when that thing that makes me happy disappears, it happens right away, like instantaneously, like with the girl I was talking to, it took the very next day and she disappeared out of my life for not reason

Bottom line: I don't know what to do, is this some sort or stage of depression? I'm sick of this nonsense that has no explanation what so ever as to why all this happens to me



Ps: sorry I know the pacing of this post was shit, I was just getting stuff off my chest, if you need any explanation dm me or comment, thank you, please don't ignore me",1
am I actually a depressed and anxious teen?,"lately I've been feeling really low, like i just got my results and they were bad and my parents taunts me every single moment and before that my friends.. i just found out that they were talking behind my back so now i legit don't have anyone to share these things. also I've noticed that I can't sleep or if I sleep o can't wake up and eat less.. like really less food. also I have severe anxiety. now what should I do? am I really depressed?",1
I guess just a rant about my unusual type of horniness lately,"I miss sex. I miss the connection of it the most usually.   But the past two days I've like, just wanted to bang. Like BANG. Not have caring sex like I normally crave and desire.

I want to like, fuck. Just the whole unbearable lust part. Animalistic. Non-romantic focused.

I can't have either type of sex due to a few factors right now such as living at home, Recovering from surgery, and I have no partner. I can't get anyone to even be a non sexual friend. And besides being overweight (due mostly to various meds and my 2.5 year long back injury) I'm a decent looking guy. I'm almost 26. I'm 5 ft 11. 280#. Dark brown eyes and hair. Nice personality. Caring. Empathetic. Extremely sensitive to people and their feelings. I can be absolutely hilarious. I am creative and make things and write stories and songs and play piano...    Like, I have stuff going for me, but no one gives a shit. I don't understand. But that part is beside the point...

The last two days I just want to go nuts with a girl like I see people do in vids. Where we're both just crazy horny and passionate. And that's unlike my usual ideal wants for sex. So it's kinda weird. Idk why I'm feeling this way. I have had an incredibly stressful last 2 to 3 week esp the past few days. So maybe my body is just like craving some kind of stress relief? Idk.      

In a way I feel bad that I want to just fuck for the selfish pleasure of it. But in another way I don't feel bad. It's, just, confusing.  Again, not that it matters cause it's impossible to get at this point in my life right now.",1
Get my feelings off my chest.,If you don’t care you don’t need to respond. But right now I want to kill my self so bad. Like i feel like I’m not enough. I know o matter and all that people care but I don’t anymore. I don’t want to live anymore. My life isn’t bad. I literally just hate myself and I never reach the requirements with my family. I try my best to actually be there for everyone. But honestly I’m drained. I want to fade away in existence and perish with no one around me to notice. I don’t wanna cause pain to my family. But I can’t help it I really just wanna self harm so bad. I wanna cry even though I don’t have the tears or even the will to cry. I’ve slowly been drowning out my misery with music but now it’s like someone’s screaming in my ear and I can’t get it off my mind. It’s starting to get bad again. And I’m probably gonna go back to just wishing I was dead.,1
what's the point. society is collapsing,"Things are about to get real hard for a lot of people. I don't care enough to stick around. The world is not going to end but a lot of people are going to die. 

Off the top of my head here's why I think we're stuffed.




- Ocean Acidification (live near the great barrier Reef. It's    dying at an alarming rate)

- Depletion of fish stocks (billions of people rely on fish as their main source of protein)

- Weather becoming more unpredictable droughts are getting worse but so are extreme weather events. Warm air can hold more moisture making storms and cyclones much more extreme.

- Less snow falling in places like Tibet and the Rockies leading to water scarcity.

- To compound on this places like Ethiopia, turkey and China are damming up rivers for energy further reducing flow for downstream nations. Likely hotspot for future conflict.

- Birth levels below replacement levels in a lot of nations leaving young people to pick up the burden of an aging population.

- This also puts time pressure on places like Russia and China if they ever want to conqueror territory

- Running out of phosphorus which is what our entire agriculture system has been built off of (the would was at 3billion people the last time we had to feed people without it.

- Oil and gas are going to run out eventually (around 40-60 years depending on how quickly my transition to renewables)

- Polarisation of media and politics due to I social media algorithms.

- Massive amounts of species are going extinct.



And many more I can't think of right now.",1
I'm just completely numb,"today was a pretty bad day, but it was very different than usual. I just didn't feel anything. I feel useless and worthless as per usual, but not really self hatred. I didn't even want to kill myself for some reason. I was just sad and it was almost worse that way",1
"Even if I decided not to kill myself, what would I even do?","I’m set on killing myself sometime in late September or early October, but I don’t know. Well…let me rephrase this. I do want to die and I’m not having second thoughts, I don’t think so anyway. Well….maybe I am. I guess I’m just looking to make sure I’ve exhausted all options that I find reasonable. To give context, I have failed out of college twice, I can’t hold a job, I’m still young though, around 21, I hate myself (I always have in one way or another), I have few to no friends, and basically no careers interest me. Tell me, what do you think I should do if I decided to stay alive? I’m just waiting a bit longer in case of a miracle. But I feel ready to die. But seriously, I can’t go back to college, I’m not motivated to find work, and I’m an outcast from society. What on earth am I SUPPOSED to do? Get “help.” I’ve tried that for practically five years now. Lots of meds, suicide attempts, a hospitalization, and therapy. As they say in Pokémon, it’s not very effective. Anyway, what else is there to do aside from end this farce?",1
Depressed thoughts,"I was listening to this YouTube debate on abortion and as they were discussing when life begins my depressed ass mind starting thinking about how most babies come out of the womb crying, and babies are always crying in general. Like iv never seen a baby come out of the womb laughing. It makes me wonder if life is just suffering from the beginning. We all wish we were kids again and look back and wish we realized how good we had it. I feel like since we were kids we just got trained to stop crying and deal with it and the suffering just gets worse and we just get better at dealing with it and sometimes it gets so bad that we cry as adults because the level of suffering has surpassed our level of dealing with it. Like for a baby their suffering is being hungry or having to shit and then as we get older we just deal with that and our suffering is having to pay bills or whatever. Obviously everyone has great happy times but so often we don’t even realize it in the moment because the only way to appreciate it is when it’s compared to sadder times. I guess this would only apply to people who are going through it lol 
Anyways this was my first Reddit post,
super random",1
two failed suicide attempts,"Within the past five months, I've had two suicide attempts that have both ended in disappointment. Despite being tired from the blood loss, and despite eventually going to sleep because the amount of blood was making me tired, I still woke up both times with my left arm covered in blood. Maybe my shirt stopped the bleeding before anything too bad happened.

It takes a special kind of idiot to mess up this kind of task twice. It's shocking, how I can't do anything right. I can't even end my own life. Maybe it's a sign. I dunno. What I do know, is that I'm sick and tired. I don't have my blades anymore, because an old friend made me throw them away. I wish I had them more than ever now.",1
fuck karma isn’t real,"if karma was real i’d either by hit by a 16 wheeler to be free of it all or given a chance to live life to the fullest with friends and a life beyond solitude.

things are not going to get better. I will live in a constant state of rot and confusion until i die. it has officially gone over the point of having a bad year or two. this is just my life now. i despise myself and every trait of mine. God i need someone",1
A living dead body waiting for it's life to end,"At first glance u might think I have all the necessary ingredients of a happy man. I come from a decent family,  both my parents are alive, I have a family of my own, a beautiful daughter, a very decent job, I have a few close friends and a lot of acquaintances. Then why do I sleep every night praying that my eyes never open, my body never wakes up anymore?

There are a number of reasons. But all of them stem from the fact that I cannot communicate myself to ANYONE, or in other words, nobody understands me. I was a moderately extroverted person in my childhood, it was I who usually took the first step in making friendship with anyone. But when I first identified that I cannot convey my exact thoughts properly, I slowly started to become an introvert. Started to talk less and tried to listen more.

I think it's good to be an introvert. I myself enjoy being an introvert now. I enjoy hearing people's perspectives rather than voicing my own opinion, and try to learn from it. But sadly, this world is a cruel place for introverts, as people constantly judges you and it's their natural instinct to  oppress the weak, it in this case those who do not have a voice.

So this took a toll on me. Since I talk less, I do not show much emotion, even if someone hurts me. Actually the anger or rage or whatever, hits me after 5-10 mins but by that time the moment is gone, I can never give a swift reply. This leads the people around me to think that I am emotionless and they can behave in whatever way they like. Since I do not talk much, no one cares to know what I like or dislike. It's just like I do not exist. 

I have an age gap with my parents and elder siblings, so it's understandable to some extent that they would not understand my thoughts or feelings. But what I cannot accept is such behavior from my same age peers, that includes my friends colleagues, wife etc.

To my wife, I am just a money making machine, nothing else. I. Just a robot, whose only duty is to keep my fily happy and that's it. I can never share my thoughts,y frustrations, anything with my wife and whenever there is a difference of opinion, all hell breaks loose, and the picture pans in such a way that somehow I am the culprit every fucking time.

I am a moderately religious person, so I ask god why did you I'm this earth? U say everyone has a purpose, but I cannot find my one. Is being a slave to everyone and just listen to everyone while bearing a mountain of pain iny chest alone is my only purpose? This cannot be. I cannot bear the burden anymore.

As I said I believe in god, I also know the punisent of suicide. But not a single day passes by when I do not think of taking a gun and shoot myself in the head, or bleed myself to death. But I am such a pathetic loser that I don't have the guts to do that. I take sleeping pills once in a while, took around 30 of them 2 days before with the hope of never getting up again but guess what, NOTHING HAPPENED. I just woke up 24hrs later, with an acidic stomach and a head weighing a thousand tons, that's all.

I think about my daughter, she is the sweetest, most meautiful and most gentle daughter in the world, and only 10 months old. Am I being selfish to her by trying to end my life? Well I think the mental state that I am right now, she will be better off without me than with me.

Why don't I go for counseling? That is because of my inability to communicate. I am pretty sure I will not be able to communicate my problems properly to them. I see no hope in my life, nothing that I can look up to, only sadness and frustration and depression. I just want this fucking life to end",1
I don't care,"I've been telling myself that I don't care about anything for a long time now but today I truely realised that I don't care about anything, I reflected on and I just don't care, also I came to realise that I don't care about social relationships and that I only keep people around me to distract myself from my inner loneliness. I don't care if I die or anyone else, I don't care about my future, neither my past on one hand it is a relieve because I don't have to try to fit in the social norms of being empathetic but on the other hand I'm now completely consumed by my misery, my mind is just a dark room in which I sit and the room is endless it's just like I'm sitting in infinite void. I'm all alone and I think it's for the better. I wonder when I'll be able to explain this to my gf because I don't think she would understand.",1

Well..,"Currently studying a 4 year degree abroad. First year went decent, second year I started to fall, only passing 7/20+ classes in 2 semesters. Now I'm in the third year, I repeated a lot of the failed subjects last year but I haven't went to class/studied a single thing. I wanna start now but I have literally 0 knowledge of the subjects since my brain has rusted since last year. Engineering btw. Lots of math.. RIP.  I wanna blame covid but it seems like a pathetic thing to do when it happened to everyone and not just me.

Since I'm studying abroad the student loans will be massive. I have no idea if I will even graduate at this point. No friends, chronic procrastination, gaming and internet addict. And porn, fuck porn. I feel like it literally sucked all my energy. I also never had a job before so maybe that's why I'm not taking this education thing seriously. Never called my parents so they don't find out I'm a complete loser. They text me but I just pretend I'm busy. But they'll find out eventually right?

Tbh I have no idea if I am depressed or just lazy. It feels like I'm using depression as an excuse for my loser-ness if that makes sense.

Just wanted to vent. Wondering if someone out there is in a similar situation.",1
How to overcome or cope with deep self-hatred and strong beliefs of inadequacy/unworthiness?,"Hello.. I am in need of some help/advice as I cannot afford therapy or any form of professional help. I know this is not a substitute for therapy or anything, but would appreciate some guidance, words of wisdom, or even little words of encouragement/hope if you have the time and energy for me..

I am a person who accepts the fact that I am a deeply insecure and avoidant type of person..that is who I am. And although my avoidant behaviors have made me feel ""safer"" and less anxious, I've faced and sunk into the black hole of their awful consequences, which are: feeling and being more empty, more lonely, and certainly more depressed.

I find myself unable to bring myself to socialize or connect with friends, family, community, or even kind strangers in so many cases/opportunities. I can't bring myself to push myself outside of my comfort zone and be willing to have life experiences, even if they're small. I've said ""no"" to things way more than I have said ""yes"", and have closed myself off from people I used to consider ""loved ones"".

I know and feel like I do not function nor exist as a normal human being, and being the way that I am brings me so much sorrow and hopelessness. It's like I'm pathetic and not strong enough to belong here in this world. I also feel like, because I've been like this for a long while now, I am just in it too deep; I'm so stuck and exhausted that I cannot dig or climb myself out.

But despite all of this, I want to learn how to overcome or cope with these heavy struggles of self-hate, insecurities, and beliefs that I am not deserving or good enough for anything or anyone. I want to at least try to figure out if healing or surviving is even a possibility for me at this point.. I do not know what to do.. How can I and how do I convince myself that I am capable and worthy of care, joy, and goodness so that I can finally begin to allow love to enter, flow, and maintain its existence within my life?",1
Young boy...,"I am a young boy (22), who cannot be seen.  I cry all the time in the middle of the night.  I am the one who lives in constant fear of the torment I have to endure and listen to.  I am the one who lives in a world full of pain and shame as others say I am hurt myself, because it is my fault.  I am the one who longs for acceptance and happiness, but it seems that no one really understands or cares.  I am the one who lives in a ruined house.  Dad and Mom divorced and he moved away.  I am the one who still keeps my painful childhood memories.  Dad beat, slapped and threw me around every day.  I am a boy with a heart that is constantly breaking.  I am the one who is so lonely and sad because I have no one and I would hide.  I am the one who was hurt by people I trusted.  My “friends” became bullies who would beat and torture me every day.  I was the one who would try to kill myself many times, but what was most precious in my head saved me.  I was the one who would squeeze all the emotions and fears, but I couldn't stand it anymore, so I cried.  I was the one who hurt myself in every possible way, from trying to cut to breaking bones.  Now I am the one who is still trying to endure, but inside I am on the verge of collapse.  But honestly, I still want to disappear.  I am a boy filled with painful emotional scars.  I'm the one who wants to escape now.  Now I am a boy who is trying to pray that everything will be better.  I am the one who still cries every night.  I am the one whose heart would be hard to fix.  I am the one who finds it hard to believe now.  I am now the one who is still afraid.  Now I am a boy who regrets having to live like this.",1
I'm 19 and lost,"So..I just need someone to listen to me and tell me what I should be doing from a third person's view. I just passed 12th and now I've taken a year drop for  medical coaching but I know one thing for sure that I am the least interested in medicine. I just did it all because everyone of my friends are doing really good and I've bummed my 12th results too. So maybe going for coaching would stall my parents' anger for a bit. But I don't enjoy it one bit and I am already tired after 3 days of classes. And I can't even leave it now as I've invested quite a lot in it financially. The thing is I was always the smart kid and never really learnt to work hard so now I need to work hard because things aren't that appealing to me and I need to force myself but I just can't.
I have another course in mind that I really want to pursue but I also bummed the entrance of that course. So I can wait 6 months to reapply for that course. But the thing is I couldn't stay at home for that long as I felt extremely guilty. My family had a lot of expectations from me but I ruined it all.
 It all started like 4 years ago when the boy I loved rejected me. I don't know if that is realated to my present situation but I can't seem to move on from him. I know it was just puppy love but I've rarely been happy in these past years and I can't focus on studying or anything. I don't like doing anything I ever loved. I constantly keep thinking about him even though it's been years since we spoke. I don't like to think anymore so I just indulge myself in media. I am at the lowest possible state at the moment. I know I should do changes instead of just blabbering here on reddit. But I can't think of anything to pull myself away from this pit. It's been 6 years that I've loved...maybe obsessed over him. Unknowingly I've made him the centre of my universe and now I don't know how to move on. When I see him now and how good he is doing with his life I am happy for him but I also feel sad for myself. Because I have turned into something so hopeless. It's not his fault at all but it's my fault for being so weak willed. I want to change.

Am I Depressed?,"Hello everyone, I made this account today so I could post Anonymously here to right this. I don’t know if I’m truly depressed or if my mind is over exaggerating it. First off I want to state, I’m not suicidal, The most I’ve ever had probably were the thoughts of what if I disappeared who would miss me thoughts, but I feel like it’s normal to have those thoughts, it’s more or less my biggest concern right now to whether I am depressed or not is over the past few months I’ve slowly stopped eating as much. I love food, and there are been points where I’ve spent a lot on food But especially these past few weeks I’ve noticed myself eating once a day sometimes not purposely but it’s like I forget that I need to eat. Also since high school my sleep schedules been very poor. It started around 10th grade throughout my high school career I would typically fall sleep around 10 to 12 wake up around one or two fall back asleep Wake up around three then wake up again around five until I had fully wake up around 6 o’clock. I pretty much did that all the way up until my senior year, and my senior year was during Covid. But it stayed like that pattern all the way up until two months ago I would say, because  it’s been like I go to bed at 4 AM and wake up at seven and then struggle to fall back to sleep and then I go to work and then repeat the cycle. Even when I take melatonin I was taking 5 1mgs And that wasn’t helping, and then I started taking 10 mg recently that hasn’t helped. I also know it doesn’t sound like I’ve been depressed as well but there are also many times where it’s late at night or I wake up and it just feels like I’m in a depressive state like I understand that it’s probably just sadness hitting but I don’t want to kill myself, and I feel like this more often than not but then I could be totally fine and happy. And then I think just dating apps haven’t helped it but then again I know I did that to myself knowing the risk of nine times out of 10 being a guy it’s so much harder to get matched or swipe down on dating apps. It’s more or less I feel like I understand the situation I’m in I don’t get suicidal thoughts but I just wanna be happy more.",1
I’m lost,"I know you probably have your own issues to deal with which is something I’ve come to realise, that everybody goes through depression at one point in their life. 
I’ve been suffering from depression from 2017 and also developed an eating disorder last year. I’ve tried getting better, tried taking care of myself but I lost track now and I don’t know how to go back. I feel like I haven’t been happy in a long time. 
Some of the things that probably triggered me are, this guy I liked, well he probably doesn’t like me back and I want to get over him but I can’t seem to even though I know he’s not a good person. I’ve been doing bad at college, I’m not sure if I should blame my mental health but I don’t know to do well on my upcoming exams. I have these massive food cravings which is getting harder to control. I’ve been vaping for months, I’m obviously addicted and it’s very hard to stop. 
I asked my parents to book an appointment with a psychiatrist, but they don’t seem too serious with what I’m going through. 
I’m too tired to go on. Thanks for reading of you did and if you have advice on how to get over someone who doesn’t deserve you and motivation to study, I’d truly appreciate it. Thanks again.",1
I don’t understand..,"Awhile ago around 2014 or 2015 I started throwing up every morning before work. It started as just gagging but eventually turned into full blown vomiting. I just had my daughter and me and my fiancé at the time determined my job was making me sick, so I quit. Billls so started getting behind of course and we almost got evicted but I found another job doing the same work, stopped throwing up for about 2 weeks and it started right back up, but we had a plan to use our taxes to pay rent off for the year when we got them I just needed to hold on…but I couldn’t. Ended up quitting in October of that year and lost my family because I had to move to another state to stay with my parents and get my shit together and eventually I did. Moved back with my fiancé after 6 months of being away and got my family back. Nonetheless it didn’t work between us and we ended up going our separate ways.THIS is my all time regret. I give y’all that long back story to say 7 years later whole different circumstance, but I’m finding myself in the same shoes AFTER 7 YEARS. I have a good paying job it’s actually a really good job, but I throw up every morning, I cry almost every morning and I don’t know why and I don’t understand it. Am I depressed? It Feels like I’m losing it again and like I’m about to lose my family again (different fiancé) and I feel so out of control. Like it’s all just happening in my face in real time and I can’t do anything about it but be sad :(. I see other people post their situations so idk I guess I just wanted to share. Hope everybody has a great day.",1
(vent),My depression is so bad lately I'm starting to feel physical pain from it like my heart strings are being plucked or pulled on or something has a tight grip on my chest it's been so long I'm just numb to it but certain times It can get overwhelming,1

I'm tired.,"I'm tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of feeling numb in the worst way. I'm tired of not having any friends. I'm tired of pretending that I'm happy around everyone else and then being miserable on my own. I'm tired of being tired. I'm tired of being ugly. I'm tired of being fat. I'm tired of being queer. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of school. I'm tired of not sleeping well. I'm tired of pretending I like my family. I'm tired of trying to stop being tired. I'm tired. Tired. Tired tired tired tired tired. Tired. 

I really do want to die. Don't care what anyone else says about it. Doesn't matter if it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Doesn't matter if it's extreme. Doesn't matter if it's selfish. Whatever it is, I want it. If being dead means feeling absolutely nothing, good. I'm glad. I just wish it was easier to die. You think you wouldn't even have to do anything to die, but somehow doing nothing is a lot of work.

Anyway, thanks for tuning in. I hope you're doing well.",1
Feeling Exhausted,Does anyone else just look at what's going on in the world and think how there is always something bad going on. That is feels like things will never change and and you most certainly will deal with the consequences of the actions of other along with the feelings of doubt and anxiety that you already have? So many problems in the world and people don't seem to realize who it hurts the most. I feel like I can't take the disappointment or let downs of the sorry condition of the world we live in where at any day of the year someones actions will tear you down and it never stops.,1
"I'm not just depressed, I'm angry","I feel both too old and too inadequate to actually live a fulfilling life. I don't have any friends and I'm too much of a misanthrope to actually want friends right now. I wish the norm for everyone is to leave each other alone and go scorched earth for humanity. We fucking suck. I don't want to have anything to do with being a human being.

I dont fucking care anymore if I sound like a hypocrite or an asshole, none of the friends or relationships I've made ever mattered in the end. I don't even want to be loved anymore, it's not like I ever knew what that meant in the first place. I'm fucking ugly and fat and goddamn introverted for anyone to be taken seriously. I'm agoraphobic, I have anxieties, worrying about people around me, thinking if they had the chance, they would hurt me. I've never trusted people.

Existence is not for me. I hate being bitter, but I'm like this because I'm too much of an enigma, I want to die so badly and I want to just tear everything apart. Why is it when I get depressed I want to just ruin everything, I'm just like my own fucking dad, too much of an emotional bitch that i have to wreck everything I see. I'm just soo fucking angry.",1
What makes it worth going on when you're a scared youth in a horrible predicament for years already anyway?,"Many of you here must have felt this way, deeply, before if not now. 

It's actually difficult to get into perspective when someone mentions the dreadful word ""suicide"". 

We all are not only strangers but also different individuals coming from completely different thought processes and experiences; so it's natural to find it difficult to empathize with someone who went / would go for the extremes of permanently terminating their life. 

Just like that.
The coworker. Sibling. Friend. Cousin. Acquaintance. Relative. Parent. Or lover and even child. 

Just like that, they're gone by the time we receive the news.  And there's no way of reaching them anymore.

But for those of us who are considering it, 
Well, personally, by this point, I have no where to go. I have no family. Or friends because I resent the idea of getting people involved in my problems as I find it inappropriate and embarrassing. I hate being a burden. 
And I've hit rock bottom.  Because it's that nearly impossible to find a solution to get out from this predicament.  No resources. No one to lean on. No loved ones.  And even If, by some miracle, I manage to crawl out of this predicament and establish a foothold,
What then? 

I will meet people. People who may be such jolly and pleasant company.  But by the end of the day, 
I am and will remain alone.  I say so, because I've ended up in my predicament thanks to betrayal and a very poor decision I've thrown myself at out of desperation and the lack of will to go on alone anymore after carrying myself, having to pull myself together from childhood. 
Abuse and neglect aren't such foreign words to everyone's ears anymore so I've always avoided acknowledgement of a past pointless matter that could hardly be fixed anymore other than by working on myself to prevent the generational trauma to be passed down to future generations.

But really, what is the point when your life is unlikely to change for the better anymore.  And even then, why continue living when sustaining one human being causes so much damage on the planet?  Why bother living when you have no power wherever you go and even if by some miracle you get your hands on it, why bother when life is such a subjective matter that depends entirely on one's perspective.  We put meaning on it, depths, but for those of us who have hit ""rock bottom"", what even is 'hope' anymore?  

To live aimlessly, playing with ""hobbies"" and wasting away by letting the seven deadly sins consume one's self, either ""waiting"" for some fairy tale story to unfold for themselves or to recklessly attempt to seize it for themselves without much thought of other people who'll be getting burned from such abrasive choice of action.

I've seen pretty things, weather, life, babies and animals, beautiful minds, such pleasant music and I have also been ""loved"".  Though now, thinking back, those ""love"" seem to have come from Ironically, self centered reasons.  Trauma bonding. Projections of yearnings and fantasies. Compensation. Atonement.  Be it from parent or lover, the deep rooted issues mentioned above have been prevalent. 

At least, I was liked and doted on no matter the reasons behind them. Motives. 

And that's enough.  Those people are gone, either deceased, due to happenstance or simply because the hormone overload from their brain ran short of supply. 
And they found someone more convenient for their free therapy than you. 

So really, why bother living?

I, personally, am still typing these thoughts down, because I don't know how to have my body disposed of afterwards.  I don't want to bleed to death because I'm already anemic and that's obviously not so pleasant a way to go.  I could ask someone to suffocate me or I could suffocate myself or poison myself with neurotoxin. 
A gas. 

Do I waste my 23 year old body and what I was blessed with, the good things and memories and experience I could use to help other children in need of someone's care and rescue, and just give up now, because I've hit rock bottom and have lost the means of surviving because of my poor decisions and reckless leap of faith that backfired in a very hideous way imaginable for someone who just wanted to settle down finally to have a family of their own they could embrace as their loved ones? 

I am a rational person who has been beaten up by the irrational, loud, obnoxious, juvenile, self centered and mentally limited victims of generational trauma in society.

I may not have a blameless record, but to be accused every time based on one's projection of inner turmoils, and have no power to even protect myself due to happenstance and poor choices made out of desperation, is just a good example of how unfair the world is. 

And how I'm just tired of it and living.

Humans won't stop hurting children. 
Humans won't stop hurting others.
Humans won't stop hurting themselves for the sake of mental stimulation because of how uneducated and mentally limited they are. 

And as for me, 
Today, as soon as day light comes, 

I am left with only the heavy void of not knowing where to go, not having enough power to even save myself, and having little to No option for the next course of action.

So I ask;
Why even strive to Live on when you could just rest and finally be at peace in death.  Maybe there is hell.
Maybe I will be tortured for eternity there god forbid.
Or maybe I'll be stuck in limbo. Purgatory. 

I just wished every night to stars to be Happy. 
Safe and secure and Happy. 
Just Happy. 

Yet here I am today, at the mercy of fate but more of the people who don't understand me and decisively opts for the alternative of sealing my fate, leaving me with nothing to even crawl with. 

This is why you should never abandon your power for anyone ever.  Never trust anyone. 

And as for my initial question,
I really don't know what to do from this point onwards with nowhere to go and no resources to cling onto.

Good night and good day.",1
Feelings about love I want to express in a book but I suck at writing,"Love is such a silly thing.

I never appreciate the love that I possess, and yet I’ll always long for the love that I’ll never get. 

Friends and family. They’re always the first in line to tell me they love me, but do they love me for me or because they have to and not because they want to. 

I think that’s why the love between two lovers feels so different. 

They have to show each other their best and support each other through their worst but there’s no “obligation” to love each other through both. 

I say both, not because of their worst, but because some may never show their worst and yet their best isn’t enough for the other to love.",1
Feeling done with humans,"Im in my late 30s. I have a dope job, no kids, a dope partner (we just got married), doing ok financially. Sounds great right? I have worked myself to dust to get here, and the hits keep hitting, I don’t have much more to give. 
1. We are losing rights, not just women, but all of us are constantly being put in more danger of a fascist state every day. I don’t know how to mentally manage that and still be a human with a job and shit.
2. My mother who is elderly, a narcissist, maga, super fucking bad with money, and unbelievably manipulative, and totally unaware of her extreme toxicity, moved to my city to be “nearer” to me. 
I told her I would help her do all the things to get a life and a place set up here, but only if she sells her way too big house and let’s me manage the money from the sale for her so I can make sure she is comfortable for the rest of her life. (She’s a swindler, is dishonest and had nothing to retire on expect the money from the sale of this house). She agrees to the terms, she’s here now, and is doing everything in her power to keep using me to get what she wants (free place to stay,meals, entertainment, chauffeur,etc) and keep the money from the sale of her house to spend frivolously. 

I have nothing left in me to give. The choice is now to roll over and get taken advantage of physically, politically, financially , or to zero contact with the family and move to a different country. I can’t keep fighting for someone else’s benefit, when no one is fighting for mine, not even in a broad political sense. When your family couldn’t be bothered to see you as anything but a means to an end, how can I reasonably expect a society to treat you any different?
I hate this place.",1

My girlfriend cheated on me and I hit a new rock bottom,"I (18m) got cheated on by my girlfriend (18f)

It's hard to imagine your life getting worse when you're already at what feels like rock bottom, but somehow life finds a way to get worse.

I've know her for a year and a half and we talked constantly. We are both depressed so lack of hobbies caused us to talk so much and we were always there for each other, supporting each other as both battled severe depression. Then 3 months ago we started dating and things only got better between us. I hated my life (still do) and felt like it was this overly exhausting relentless hell I was trapped in, but I at least had a beautiful girlfriend by my side. She was the one thing going right in my life, perfect even. 

Then she said she regretfully got drunk and cheated on me and if course broke up. Funny how life has a way to take the best thing in your life and have it put you at the lowest you have ever been.",1
Started self harming again,Does anyone have ideas on how to distract myself from it? I’m a bit empty and I don’t know see my therapist again until Monday.,1
I feel terrible,"Hello everyone-I'm new here and, at the risk of coming out of the gate swinging, I wanted to tell a bit about myself in an effort to seek some advice, as I feel like I might be going through something.

In 2006 I was convicted of several misdemeanors; I’ll be honest-I was working an extremely low-paying job and was desperate for money. Obviously, my plan didn’t work out.

Although I didn’t receive a jail sentence and just had to pay a fine, the misdemeanor convictions have continued to severely follow me mentally. I take full responsibility for what I did and I’ve been able to find employment, though it isn’t quite as easy as it was prior to my arrest, and am married with two children since those events as well. I also went back to school where I received a college degree.

However, I struggle with feelings of worthlessness daily. I broke off contact with friends when all this happened, and think about those convictions on a daily basis-the worst is when I’m lying in bed late at night. I truly don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to escape these feelings, and that I’ll forever see myself as a massive loser who let those closest to him down.

I was a decent person before all this happened-the worst thing I’d received was a speeding ticket. I have spoken to a few therapists but they haven’t proved fruitful. I’ve considered suicide more times than I can remember-to others, it may seem like I’ve turned things around, but internally I see myself as a complete and utter failure.

Any advice would help. I’m not trying to throw a pity party, I’m just feeling sad, all these years later. I don’t know what I can do to start to feel better about myself. I also realize there are people who need more help than I do. I must apologize if I'm rambled too much, or am posting on the wrong part of the site. I don't mean to waste anyone's time-at the very least, it feels good to talk about this and appreciate someone reading my message.",1
Something is very wrong with me.,"I feel like I should say something, even if it’s anonymously through the interwebs. I’m a 31 M with what most people would consider a relatively successful life. I have a loving wife, an amazing young daughter who is becoming a smart young lady very quickly and a new born. We own a home and I’m on a decent salary if I were to look at it in an individual basis. Unfortunately for a family, not so much. 

Recently, I’ve been waking up with some really dark thoughts in my head. The most common one is “I dont want to wake up” and “I can’t be bothered living”. This all stemmed from my inability to get a new, higher paying job. The pressure has really been on to me lately because my wife doesn’t work to look after the newborn (and I want her to have the option of not working). I’ve been applying and always getting fucked at the 11th hour. That could be losing the spot to an internal hire, getting to last stage and not making it, or even getting cucked by my own company. It’s beginning to really make me question my ability to provide and in turn my own self worth. I think what really got to me is I applied for an internal promotion and my team didn’t even have the respect to tell me the result. It’s been 9 weeks and I initially followed up but they said it was still under review. That really made me feel quite shitty. I feel like scum for even thinking like this because there are so many people down on their luck and in way worse situations, yet I have the audacity to think this stuff. 

Everyday in the morning that feeling grows too which in some ways is the worst part of it all, and I’m not sure what to do. It’s also beginning to have an impact on my family and my mood swings really wildly from the smallest of things only to regret my actions later.",1
Why it is difficult to make friends after 25?,"I moved to another country for Masters degree it is getting really difficult to make friends . so let me tell briefly about my situation:

Moved abroad thinking better peer group could work together on class projects make new friends explore the city etc.. like very common stuff but it turnout to be completely opposite to me.

I am kind of introvert but i wanted to change myself come out the bubble and when I moved initially I talked with everyone I used to listen to them and ask question based on conversations. tried every stuff to make some friends. called them to grab some drinks but every time the response was no or busy random excuse. (note: my class is fully international no local student so kind of new for everyone). I was nice to everyone attentive asked about some situations where mentioned something in past conversations. every time its me who initiates the conversations and I don't get any follow up questions. so after a month I got feeling they are not interested in spending time or talking with me because I see their post on instagram going out and I am not invited and the one thing made me sad was I didn't get any group to do some class projects (I had to do alone).

After month of realizing they were not interested I just tried what if I don't speak will anyone initiate conversation? but daam nobody cared It was like I've never existed in the class. No handshakes or greetings (I sat in front row near to entrance). this made me depressed all alone in new country no one to talk to no peer group to study (most of classmates study together and I was never invited I asked few people if I could join because I am unable to understand few concepts but response was sorry). I was not invited to new years party, trips around country where almost entire class was there It made me really sad I mean I didn't do anything bad.

I celebrated my birthday alone no wishes ( I didn't cared about back in my home but here alone depressed this situation rubbed salt to the wound) because I planned a party if anyone remembers my existence to make friends I brought lot of booze, Food etc a week before planned to make some good food from my country but I ended up alone.

so I know they don't hate me but at the same time they don't care. I am a human I need some social life to survive just small thing's I wish going out, garbing drinks, eat out you know general stuff.

What could be the reason of me not able to make friends?

1. Do men care about the looks of other guy they hangout or to make friends? (PS: I am kind not so good looking, short, bald, pigmentation) (I know this is silly to ask but I don't know other side of world holds some different opinion because most of my classmates they are friends/groups with people who look good you know typical Tall and stuff.. I know this sentence shows my insecurity but I am not I accepted myself but whenever we talk some random stuff they don't consider my opinion or they don't give any response it's like they didn't care but it is different or other way around for other even though sometimes that opinion doesn't make any sense)
2. I am not so smart?
3. I don't bring anything to the table no sports, no musical instruments, no singing/dancing, no knowledge of anime, movie buff etc., (maybe not an interesting guy to talk to)

I am kind of really depressed and suicidal sometimes I tried meeting people outside of my class but still I get the same feeling (not interested to talk or make friends the usual indications, with lot of experience past now I know are people really interested to talk/make friends when I talk to them. I know I should learn to live alone but I don't want to end up alone without any friends and I like to have some small stuff like going out and In my field it's really difficult to get a job without proper network.

So Fed Up,"Going on 24 years old, and haven’t had any serious friends or relationship since my freshmen year of high school. I feel like I’m living in the movie ground hog day every single day I wake up is just the same useless grind.

I am on new anti depressants and I am awaiting some sort of counselling therapy which I’ve never done before here’s hoping it all improves. Anyone else have the non appetite thing before ?",1
I’m just over it.,"I’m just tired of living in a life that has no purpose. I wake up go to work get ppl scheduled for dental appointments, talk to insurance companies and take payments from pts and repeat. While I see my friends becoming doctors/dentists/pharmacists, I’m just getting yelled at and belittled by office manager. How do I go from working along side the best doctor having the best grades to getting belittled for not knowing how/which dental insurance works. 99% of the time I’m like I hate this job and want to just get up and leave. The 1% I’m like I don’t want to start all over. I was in major depression slump for about 8 months and didn’t get out of bed. So I see it as a step in the right direction. Like I’m contributing to society. But tbh I am over life. There is no purpose and I’m just over it. I’m ready to die. I wish god could just end it all bc depression+ belittled+ seeing others live out my dream just sucks+ ocd+ anxiety= I’m tired tbh. I’m tired of trying to be a positive sport and handling everyone’s work stress especially the office managers and her freak outs on me when I’m not mentally okay either. Like wow ur stressed out at least ur not taking 3 meds to get u out of bed and one of the meds is twice a day. How can someone’s life chance in a blink of an eye? 06/2021 it’s my best life then 06/2022 I’m struggling to stay alive. This is just my rant since I have no one to talk to. I wish I could disappear. I think I’m just sad bc I’m holding onto I dream I worked so hard for to just be gone in a split second. Life is funny that way I guess.",1
Is my depression valid?,"I’ve been massively struggling with mental health, depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts for about a year now and one of the things that makes it hit especially hard some nights is issues with completely unrequited love, I told one of my friends this and they told me I was just being sad pathetic and creepy, so I was just wondering if it’s a valid feeling or if I am what my friend said?",1
expired,"Expired

I've expired.
I'm no longer relevant, like a product with no buyers. I'm old fashioned. I'm not interesting. Not fun. I'm not adventurous and no longer full of potential. I'm depleted, deflated. Like an old tape that won't rewind. The movie was great but it's over, and if you can't rewind it it has no use. The truth is I was never in fashion, always too young or too old for my age, always not yound enough or not old enough for my surroundings, either outdated or living before my time . I expired before I ever begun. I was always out of context and almost every time misunderstood. Always a foreign object not matching my background. Always either a gray spot on a colorful painting or a bright red blood stain on the sleeve of a white dress. I was never more relevant than in the past and always full of potential in the future. I'm a candle burning bright in an empty dark room and a dead plant on a lovely bright shelf. I do not belong, no matter where I go it is not my place. I don't blame myself even though I'm always the odd but I don't blame you either. Solitude is my worst enemy and my greatest pain but believe me it is my very best solution. I'm gone already so if this text lives it'll almost be ironic.",1

It's frustrating and at the same time sad, for the first time of my life I'm trying get out of my comfort zone and be more sociable and I suck.",1
I Hate Life and Myself,"I can't help but think that there is so much wrong with me. It feels like I spent the last few years bettering myself and training myself to be happy in any situation in life... but at 21 I feel like I've hit rock bottom in a way I've never before. As the days go on, the more bleak life seems. All the activities I used to enjoy that would lift up my mood don't do anything to help now. I don't enjoy any of my old hobbies. I'm constantly stuck in this mental state where I am comparing everyone's life to my own. I feel like a useless, pathetic, unlikeable, ungrateful human being. I am constantly miserable and it shows on my face. Everyone around me just appears better-looking, happier and content with whatever life they have. I think moving home has drastically decreased my happiness but I can't do anything about it for the next year. I don't know how I can go on that long. Living here I need to meet my family's expectations on everything I do. How I dress, where I go, who I'm with. It takes an extreme toll on me because it feels like they would never accept the real me. It feels like my whole life I have been waiting for good things to happen. Having friends that are in the same place in life as me or friends I can relate to. I have been craving for a sense of community for so long... I want to feel like I belong with some people. No matter how hard I try to meet people and create relationships, people don't seem to like me. I just feel like no one makes an effort to have me in their life. It was so hard because when I was with my ex he was so liked and made friendships so easily. Sometimes my own friends would speak to him more than me. That always hurt. I really try to be a good human being. I don't like creating drama or conflict in any relationship I have. I have truly never had bad intentions with people. So, I always wondered what I lacked. With him I felt like the uglier, less likeable one. It just feels like there is so much wrong with me.  Although I do have a friend it just feels like I've outgrown that friendship. I can't help but wish I had a different childhood. I wish I grew up with a different family, in a different place. I wish I was raised differently. Maybe in that life I would've been happy and life wouldn't have been a constant struggle.",1
Hitting a bad spot in my late 30s,"I feel very unaccomplished. 

I have a full time job, and I'm still managing to go out with friends. I don't have a spouse or kids. I want those. 

I've dealt with high anxiety, of not feeling good-enough to marry a woman. 

I sometimes just feel like I've done so little with myself, and feel like I am not a role model for kids nor attractive to a wife. 

I don't wish to continue on this way. Everything is giving me such anguish and anxiety that I cannot sleep at night. 

I really feel like I am purposeless.",1
i want to kill myself so badly but i just can't,"i'v tried to do so many things. can't drown myself. can't cut myself so i'd bleed to death. can't jump from a high place. can't hang myself. can't jump in front of traffic even when i was so done that being gone was more important than bringing traumatic discomfort to whoever would witness it. and even the one time i managed to do something and gulped down a 200% lethal ammount of meds, it didn't work either.

my survival instinct won't let me ""cross the line"" if i can physically do anything about it. my intolerance to pain and discomfort won't even let me get near that line and then if i somehow find a way to get past those two things my body will pull a deus ex machina and prevent me from dying anyway.

i am so tired of this, i hate life, i hate having to be alive, i hate the lack of options i have to end it. it's not fair, i never asked to be born, i never asked to be alive, i never asked to be conscious. i was forcefully put in this bullshit that i despise and now i have to be there for who knows how long with little to no regard for what i want or don't want.

i wish i could just say i'm done and entirely disappear but life doesn't work that way and i have pay for it with all this time that's forced on me.

i despise all of this. life isn't a gift, it's a curse that keeps on giving, damned be your consent and if you happen to like it then it's gravy, otherwise you can go fuck yourself till you like it.

i'm so tired of it. it's never going to get better in a meaningful way because having to be alive in itself is a huge part of it for me. it can only get less worse if i'm lucky but then again, that's just making your uncurable cancer more bearable with pain meds.

i want to be gone, i want to die, i want to disappear, i want to vanish, i just don't want to ""be"" and it shouldn't be that much to ask for when i was forced into this shit to begin with

I am a horrible person and I deserve to suffer,"I apologise for the length/rambling, I suppose this is more of a vent post than anything else.

I was the biggest prick as a kid, I was incredibly conceited and narcissistic and I always acted as if the world owed me a favour. I would brag, boast, bitch and backstab. I was deceptive, manipulative and petty.

It took succumbing to horrid depression and several suicide attempts to bring me to my knees and rid me of my ego (and any ""normal"" self-esteem). Now that I'm older and self-aware, I'm starting to hate myself more and more for being as awful as I was. I lost friends and shattered relationships because of my own arrogance, and it repulses me.

The worst part is, the magnitude of my regret is founded in things I can't possibly change now. I can't take back those words, or untell those lies, or repair those lost friendships, and it's killing me. I'm convinced that this is God or the universe's way of punishing me, by forcing me to relive it all and break under the helplessness of being unable to undo any of it.

I may not be an outright asshole today, but I am still a bad person nonetheless. I am a bad person because I am still capable of being the piece of shit that I was, and because others have suffered because of me.

I've often thought about suicide (again), and while often it is a brave act, in my case it would be nothing but a coward's death. Dying by my own hand would be taking the easy way out, so I remain here. But it's getting increasingly harder to stay, because every day I hate myself a little bit more. And every day I give myself a very good reason to.

I don't know anymore. I'm a horrible person, and rather than deserving a quick death, I deserve to be kept in hell, tortured by my own conscience but unable to change a single fucking thing.

I deserve to suffer for what I've done.",1

I can't anymore,"We wanted to watch a movie as a family. Then the telephone rang and my mother picked up, my sister went to her room, singe my mother always talks for like an hour. My mother got angry, really angry. She yelled at her, but my sister didn't came back. Then she called her ahs my sister stopped the phone call in the middle of it, my mother told my dad to go and grab my sister, but she locked herself into the bathroom so he couldn't do it.
Then we started the movie and my mom is complaining all the time, at one point I just say ""Mom"". Just ""mom"", i didn't say anything else. She starts yelling, screaming, she throws her phone at the floor, it breaks. More screaming, because apperantly it's my fault that she threw her phone on purpose on the floor and it broke, I don't say anything. She picks it up, throws the broken phone in my direction and scares my dog with it.
""what was that for? You know the dog is here?!"" I yell and cuddle my scared dog.
She screams and walks away.then my father screams at me,  because ""You know how your mother is!""

I shouldn't have said ""mom"", can't even say anything, I'm always walking on eggshells.

I cuddle my dog more and then I go to my room, crying ofc.
More screaming from my mom, then my dad comes into my room and says, that I should give my mother my old phone.

""god, I wish I would at least get an apology"" I say, but I know it wouldn't happen, because she never apologised for anything in my whole life, even if something happens on accident. I never heard my mother apologise to me or another family member or so.
I give her my old phone, but she doesn't want it anymore, it's disrespectful to want an apology (I mean, I gave it her anyway, I just said it without meaning it, because I knew l wouldn't get one).
More screaming and I can't Fucking find the key to my door, my heart is pounding, I want to leave.
I want to leave so badly, why do I have to be born into this family? I wish I could just die. I want it to end. I think about suicide everyday, but I know I can't do it, I'm too afraid that I somehow survive and have to deal with the consequences.


Now she said ""you don't even have a reason to cry""

I first tried to kill myself at the age of 11,I hated myself, gut bullied my whole life. Can't be myself, can't trust anyone, not even my family.
They always abused me emotionally, so far that I still cry when I see and think about happy familes, I cried when the mother of a friend complimented my good grades (I have to say that I really do have good grades, because of else there would be punishment).
I could never be happy, I don't have a single person in my life that I can fully trust, I only love my dog because I can't trust people, I have friends, I like them, but I can't talk with them about my life at home and my thoughts or all the things I experienced in the Internet, grooming for example.
I only have myself and my dog and I got no reason to cry?
For years I have a plan that when I won't kill myself until the age of 27 I'm going to finally do it when I'm 27, in the past I even had suicide pacts with other people who are as ill as me.
I just can't anymore, but apparently I don't have a reason to cry.

Should I see a therapist?,"(23M) So 3 months ago something terrible happened to me. The short version of it is that one of my really close friends betrayed me and went to do something really petty which caused my ex girlfriend to dump me. The shock I received was enormous and during the first month I was a mess, borderline severe depression. I no longer had the motivation to do anything, and I pretty much fell beind with almost everything productive in my life, like with university, and other activities I used to enjoy. I even stopped enjoying my hobby activities that I used to do. Things that I used to look forward to doing suddenly became a chore and sth to just get over with. I also had trouble getting up from bed in the morning. Sometimes I didn't even feel sleepy. I just wanted to lay all day in my bed, even later during the day.

Now, it's been 3 months and although I can say I'm not so much of a wreck as I was during that first month, I'm still showing lots of symptoms of mental illness. I still can't enjoy the things I used to enjoy and everything just seems to be hopless. It just feels like the whole world is coming down on me. Maybe the fact that I started talking again with my ex a couple of months ago (a month after the whole incident), but only on friendly terms, didn't help cause it never really helped me move on. I don't know what to do anymore so I feel like my state of mental health is at Defcon 1. I legit feel that it won't get any better unless I see a shrink, it seems to have come down to this. But again I feel bad for spending all that money to go see a shrink cause I can't help but see it as ""money that could be spent elsewhere"".

The bottom line is I'm feeling like I no longer have the emotional buoyancy to keep going, and that I'll only keep going down from here. Is 3 months too long for those feelings to persist or is it going to get better? Do you think I should go see a therapist no matter what? Thank you all in advance.",1

I pretend to be happy infront of everyone that I know but internally I am hurting, my heart feels heavy all the time.

"23F i hate my body so much, it makes me not want to live","Update: Thank you everyone for your guidance and feedback. I’m realizing this is more a matter of my rocky relationship with myself and my body as well as my frustrations with societies standards, rather than my relationship. Writing this post, I was in a dark place and needed to get my disordered thoughts out. Everyone’s feedback has helped bring me back down to reality and I appreciate it❤️

Tl: my boyfriends (24M) actions have contributed to  me (23F) falling back into deep depression 

There is a lot of pre context to be said but I’ll try to keep it to the need to know.

I always seem to attract men who are bad for my mental health. I fall hard, get in a relationship with them, and then am stuck feeling so depressed without the strength to leave.

In all my past relationships, the fact that I don’t look like the “expected” attractive female has been an issue. I’m 4 foot 11, 100 pounds. I’m not super fat, but I’m not slim either. I have no curves, no chest, and no ass. It’s always been a major point of insecurity for me even before getting into relationships, as I’ve always been treated as if all my worth depends on me being sexy and having a certain body type and picked on for my body type. 

I’ve been with my current partner since January 2021. From the beginning, I was transparent about my complicated past with body image, past partners, and finding someone who prefers the type of woman that IIIII am. Throughout our time knowing eachother, my partner has continuously given attention to women who look the opposite of me (slim, curvy, and of course, mostly women with huge asses). It doesn’t help that all of his exes fit this description. The attention he has given other women who has been through Instagram, OnlyFans, Pornhub and Twitter. I voice my feelings several times over our time together, and all he said the first atleast 3 times I brought it up was “I’m sorry I’ve made you feel this way” but the behavior never changed. Eventually, I brought it up yet again and he decided to delete his Instagram. 

Fast forward to now, we’ve been living together for a month. I recently tumbled upon his pornhub history on the computer and while I know that was never meant for my eyes, it confirmed every insecurity I have about myself and his preferred type of woman.

I feel triggered, disgusting, ashamed, not good enough, and honestly like I am right back in my past, with someone who’s preferences are destroying the confidence I fought so damn hard to build for myself.

He wants to know how he can help me with these feelings, but I don’t know what to tell him. Is there anything he can say or do  to help me gain back my confidence? Or should I just count my losses and try to move on, hoping that maybe one day I can find a partner who actually prefers someone who looks like me?☹️",1
Struggled with Depression On and Off For Over 10 Years Now,"The first time I ever experienced depression was in 2009 back when I was a teenager. Part of it was low self-esteem, part of it was that the first girl I ever fell in love with didn't feel the same way, part of it was other stuff. This lasted until about the start of 2011.

In the beginning of 2011 I met my first serious girlfriend. She really turned things around for me at the time. I still had dark moments and dark days, but for the most part she made me very happy. She made me feel better about myself too. She made me feel worth something, and smart, and beautiful.

Things ended between us towards the end of that year though.

Afterwards I started going to college. But I developed social anxiety and failure anxiety.

The social anxiety started when I was much younger but subtly at first. In the beginning I just found it stressful to make calls. Then eventually I went out with my friends less and would refuse sometimes because of it. Then in college when I was first in a place where I knew nobody it got out of control. Eventually I couldn't go to classes anymore and didn't even dare to take the bus or go to the store anymore.

My failure anxiety started a little bit when I was a teenager too but this also reached a peak when I first started going to college. I didn't dare to take exams anymore and so my first year of college I essentially did nothing.

After a while I started falling back into depression and really this lasted until about the end of 2014, the beginning of 2015.

I started going to a new psychologist then who helped me a lot. She helped to reduce my social anxiety to the point that I could take busses again, go to the store again, go to classes again. She didn't take it away entirely and there was stuff I continued to struggle with but she did make it a lot better. She also helped to give me ways to control my failure anxiety and I did my first actual exams in college in 2015.

Towards the beginning of 2015 I also met my second serious girlfriend, though we weren't together for a long time (only a month or two). By the end of 2015 I'd met another girl and in the beginning of 2016 she became my third serious girlfriend.

At this moment my depression was largely under control, I had a girlfriend again, my social anxiety was getting better and I was progressing in college.

However, in 2018 suddenly I learned something unexpectedly. I won't go into details to protect her privacy, but back when our relationship ended I'd always thought my first serious girlfriend didn't love me anymore (though I still loved her). In 2018 though I found out that our entire break-up was a complete misunderstanding. That she still loved me and continued to love me for years afterwards (just as I'd continued to love her).

This hurt me a lot and made me feel very guilty for not understanding what was happening at the time and for losing a person that had made me feel valued and loved when the entire world had seemed empty and dark. I blamed myself. I then entered into yet another severe depression. I almost killed myself during this time.

By the middle of 2019 though that first serious girlfriend heard about what was going on and contacted me about it. We talked everything out and I apologized to her and she accepted it. I was still with my third serious girlfriend at this time, so we didn't get back together or anything. But we ended things on good terms that day.

For a few months everything was going alright, but in 2020 with covid things got harder again.

Covid put a lot of strain on the relationship between me and my third serious girlfriend because she had a very different response to the pandemic than me. On top of that, we were barely able to be together during this period and that was also bad for our relationship.

As I said earlier my failure anxiety had been brought under control with help from my psychologist, however in 2020 it got worse again. As I also said earlier the failure anxiety might've been under control but it wasn't gone. Doing exams was still extremely stressful and difficult for me. The stress from the pandemic caused it to reach a boiling point. I started wanting to cry in the showever every day, my hair started falling out and I started almost having panic attacks when I even thought about doing exams ever again.

After this 2020 exam period I knew I could never participate in exams again. So I had to quit college without a diploma exactly 1 year before I would've gotten it (I'd done a 6 year trajectory, only doing half of the exams each year in order to help with my failure anxiety).

Later that month my third serious girlfriend broke up with me.

I entered another severe depression.

A few weeks later she contacted me again though. Said that she might be interested in getting back together but also saying that I had to wait until she had finished her studies herself before she'd make a definitive decision about whether we'd get back together.

So I was feeling a bit better, but still not in a good place. I was unemployed without a diploma and I still didn't know for sure if I'd get my girlfriend back.

Then early in 2021 suddenly my third serious girlfriend ghosted me. For a month she didn't speak to me at all. This was a very dark month for me. I thought she might have changed her mind on wanting to get back together but I didn't know. I often contemplated suicide during this month. By the end however she did contact me again. I was still hurt by what she did but I decided to pretend everything was normal.

By april of that year we'd gotten back together.

I was over the darkest part of the depression of that point though still not quite happy. I'd tried to re-enroll in college to please my third serious girlfriend but I knew almost certainly that I couldn't handle it. My relationship with her also never became normal again. A distance stayed between us and she treated me far worse than before.

She'd always had some problems, tbh. Since the beginning we were together. For example, one time we hadn't seen each other for like 2 months and the day when we finally could again she went out with her friends instead. And the days after that she stayed at home, cooking. Then a few months later when I had already made plans with a friend to go somewhere and she suddenly wanted to come over for the weekend (she decided this on a friday evening) and I told her that I couldn't until sunday cuz I had plans she threw a hissy fit. She basically demanded that I cancel my plans with this friend. I did in the end reschedule them.

She also would often refuse to talk about our problems. Once in 2017 she gave me the silent treatment for like 2 months. I tried to talk about our problems many times but she refused until finally we talked things out after like 2 months of this stuff.

She would also sometimes be incredibly cold towards me. Ignore my feelings.

My first serious girlfriend made me feel loved and worth something and smart and beautiful. My third serious girlfriend often made me uncertain whether she even loved me. Sometimes made me feel like a screw-up and not worthy of her.

After we got back together our relationship got worse. For example when we were together before we would talk online every day when we couldn't see each other IRL. However, at this point she would often ignore my messages. Just not talk to me many days.

One day I was extremely tired. I had sent her a message but figured she wouldn't answer. I went to sleep thinking she wouldn't answer anyway. The next day I woke up and she'd answered. When I started talking to her that day she was clearly very angry though she denied it.

After the events of that day she basically gave me the silent treatment again. I would try to talk to her and say a lot. She would respond to almost every message with ""Ok"" and ""Uhu"" over and over again. I asked her several times to talk it out. The first few times she kept denying she was even angry. Eventually she admitted that she was but said she didn't want to talk about it. I told her that I loved her and that I would wait until she was ready to talk, however long she needed.

The silent treatment continued and she didn't even ask to come over anymore. The one time when I asked her to come over (I waited a while cuz I thought she didn't want to to even ask) she told me ""I already have plans."" just very platly and without emotion.

She'd also stopped telling me she loved me at this time.

In the meanwhile I had failed to continue college (as I predicted I couldn't do exams without almost getting panic attacks all the time) and I was just unemployed again. Not having a diploma though made finding a decent job hard. I was also starting to feel quite depressed again at this time, more than before. The one thing that kept me going was that I still had my girlfriend, even though obviously things were bad between us too.

Then at the start of 2022 she broke up with me.

Since then I've probably entered the worst depression in my life. I have no money, I still live with my parents, I don't have a diploma, I don't have a job, I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have basically any friends (social anxiety will do that) and tbh these days I really miss my first girlfriend. Like... I miss her a LOT.

She made me feel valued and loved at a difficult time and I feel like I lost her for no reason and I would do anything to have that back.

I'm also someone who loves to write. It was my dream to become a professional novelist. However, over the last few months I've been so depressed that I've even lost the ability to write. I just... can't write anymore. That was pretty much my only outlet and the only sense of purpose left to me. And I can't do that anymore either.

Nowadays I mostly spend my days endlessly scrolling through Reddit and Twitter for hours at a time. I used to play video games, but I don't even get any joy out of that anymore. So I barely play anymore.

So that's my story, I guess.

I've been struggling with social anxiety, with failure anxiety, with no self-esteem and with severe depression on and off for over a decade now.

My psychologist wants me to keep fighting and tells me that things can be better again. But I've been fighting for over 10 years now and I'm tired. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm tired of everything having to be a struggle for me. I don't believe anymore that things can get better.

No girl out there wants an unemployed, depressed piece of trash like me. And without someone by my side I have nothing else. I don't have the motivation to get better or get a job anymore. I don't see any way forward anymore.

So I really just want it to be over now. I currently have a plan to end things in a few months. Maybe I'll change my mind, but at this point I'm like 95% certain that I'll do it this time. I've thought about and almost attempted suicide many times throughout the last 10 years. This time I'm guessing I'll do it.

That's all.

I will never have a job ever again, there’s no point in even trying to search and apply because nobody will ever hire me anyway. So I will forever be broke and unable to make money to pay my bills. 

I’m a disappointment to everyone. Including my family because I stopped trying, because I saw no point in it. Nobody will understand that I’ve already given up. 

And yes actually I am alone and will forever be alone. Because I deserve to be. I’m done, and there is absolutely no hope for me.",1
"Slipping back into depression, I don’t know what to do","Last time my depression got bad was 4 years ago, and it got a lot better. I changed schools and finished my exams. I was happy with my new routine and finally getting special needs attention that they didn’t give me in my old school. Maturing also helped me stick up for myself more and I developed a better relationship with my parents. 

But.. I finished my exams, my dad got really close to loosing his job, so now we’re moving to a small apartment to manage the pay cuts from covid. All while I’m waiting for my results to see weather I’ll be able to study abroad or not. All I want is to make my parents happy, but I’m stuck in this weird period of limbo. I don’t know how to be a young adult, I don’t know how to prepare myself for all of the big transitions coming my way. I’m 18 btw just graduated. I got to leave my family behind in a month.. Ive been letting my room get messy again. Sleeping all the time, I’m sad and frustrated all the time.

Worse of all I hate myself. How I look, how I talk, how I socialize. I thought it was getting better, I don’t want it to get bad again not when I’m supposed to be going into the world to support myself.

Idk what to do. I just need a hug",1

Hey guys thanks for everything!,"I think this is it for me. I’m so lonely that I hug the clothes in my closet as if they were real people. I get all dressed up to go to the store expecting someone to notice me, but I pass by as if I’m invisible. My friends left me one they saw my cutting scars. My counselor said to have a “fuck it” type mentality look where that got me. Do my parents really love me if it took them 11 years to find out that I was hurting. After over 2 decades of living and 7 suicide attempts. I’ve lost my mental battle. If you asked me to look into the future to see what I would become I wouldn’t know what I’d see; however if I were asked if I wanted to see how I died…I wouldn’t care because I already know it’ll be by suicide, it’s just a matter of time. Thanks for talking to me and replying to me. Maybe this won’t be the end?

What to do when you feel that you’re carrying the weight of the world?,it’s just one of those days where you feel that you’re carrying the whole world with you each time you try to stand up.

mourning driving me crazy,"An ex that broke up with me in January hit me back up in March. I really cared about her, I went to see her, nothing much happened except talking, I ghosted her after that for my own sanity. 2 weeks after I saw her and 1 1/2 weeks after I last heard from her, she was killed in a car wreck. I am still being driven crazy over it. She comes up in my dreams, I catch myself saying ""I miss you"" multiple times a day, my job makes me pass the interstate exit she was killed on most days of the week. It's killing me, I feel like 3 months is enough time to mourn but I still am. It's a little bit better than it initially was but Jesus It's driving me crazy. I drink to keep my mind off it at night.

What songs do you listen to when you're depressed?,"I'm looking for some music to listen to when things get bad. I don't want to feel worse, or feel better for that matter, just need something to vibe to as I watch my world crumble around me.",1
I'm not the same person I once was.,"My life story could be described by tragic, at least that's what I've been told. To keep it short, I was an unwanted child, my parents never wanted to have a child, but it unfortunately happened, which meant that I've always been deprived of basic affection and attention from my parents, especially my father, also, I used to get hit and threatened for no valid reason throughout my entire childhood, so I developed a cocoon, I avoided talking and interacting with others my whole life to avoid being treated by others the same way my parents treated me, and at school, well, it didn't go well either as I was either bullied or ignored by the entirety of my classmates.

As I grew up, things didn't change, but I started to seek friendship and companionship, unfortunately, I was never able to make friends, have a girlfriend or even connect with anyone, I've always been seen as the boring, unfunny, lame introverted dude, and although I've always felt sad about this situation, I was fine with it for a long time, that was until I met a girl last year who used me in every possible way she could, all while pretending I meant something to her, but the truth is she despised me, but she needed me to achieve her hidden objective which was to befriend and later more with the only dude that I considered as a friend, and from there becoming a part of his little group, which she successfully did.

She didn't waste a single second, as soon as she got what she wanted she outed me out of the equation, and the guy she wanted outed me too, which meant I lost my only friend in the process. The next few months were rough, they were by far the hardest period I've ever been through, I was truly at my deepest low, seeing them everyday in university was even worse considering that we shared the same exact classes.

I started to feel better after a while, but, as soon as things started to settle, I met another girl who was truly wonderful, she was cool, funny, interesting, comprehensive, supporting, she was the total package, and everything was going fine until she confessed that she did have feelings for the same guy I talked about before. I was obviously disappointed so I decided to distance myself to not get hurt more, and she noticed and confronted me about it, and then admitted that I never meant anything to her. After some time, we started pretending that neither of us existed but seeing her flirt with him still affected me in a certain way but I always kept my composure in every given situation.

All of this led me to question myself about why I was the way I was, why am I never enough for anyone ? why am I ignored by everyone ? why can't I make friends like everybody else ? these questions haunted my mind for months, I even thought about ending it all, until one day, and I don't why, I stopped caring, I do not feel any emotion or excitement whatsoever, everything feels so dull and bland, I stopped seeking social interactions, I stopped trying, nothing feels meaningful, even happy moments or news regarding my life don't affect me anymore, I'm living on autopilot mode at this point, I've isolated myself completely, I don't talk to anyone, and when I do, I don't even know what to say or how to act, I try keeping it short, I've lost the ability to maintain conversations or even flirt with a girl, everything feels so boring, aimless and useless.

I kinda miss my old self sometimes, but in the meantime I wonder why I should even care as not caring is what's keeping me sane, I do feel sad, but nowhere near as much as I did before this sudden transition, so I'm guessing my mind is protecting me from the traumatic events that could've happened if I continued trying by silencing and suppressing my emotions, I know this is far from ideal, yet I still wish to stay this way for eternity if it means I'll never have to deal with those emotions of confusion, betrayal and heartbreak again.",1
At what age did you realized you were screwed for life?,"I'm 24F, I have 2 kids and no useful education.
I come from a wealthy family. Not crazy rich, but just above the average. We could travel and eat at restaurants weekly. My parents were going to pay for my entire education, no matter I wanted to do.

I wanted to be an ER doctor, but I wasn't good enough in maths and where I live, you need to be the absolute best in all your college classes to have a chance to be admitted in med school. For this reason, I dropped out of college because I wasn't good enough to be a doctor and that's the only job I was seeing myself do for my entire life. 

I moved in with my boyfriend and started working in a jewelry store and in sales at a lingerie store, thinking I would go back to school when I figure out what I want to do.

A year and a half later I took supply management in college because that's what my mother is doing. I did not finish it and hated every minute of it. 

I broke up with this boyfriend and met my spouse a couple months later, following the second drop out. I got pregnant after 6 months together and was at this point working as a tech archivist (also hated EVERY second I spent in this cold lowlight basement). Got fired when they knew I was pregnant ( I also had a rough pregnancy with lots of vomiting and er visits for rehydration ).

When my daughter was born I started online college classes in graphic design. I got my diploma and started working as a secretary for a contractor and accounting assistant because I wanted to redo my portfolio because I wasn't happy with it. I thought I would work there for a couple months and finish my portfolio. 

I worked there for a year and then, my spouse got a promotion and we moved 8 hours north, got a house and a second baby on the way. 

My son is 2 months old, my daughter is 3 and my diploma is useless, even if I'm ""good"" as a graphic designer. 

So I have no adequate education, 2 kids at home because there are no spots available in daycare  (so not a chance to go back to school) and no money. I'll have to work part time in a bar because there's nothing else better (for me) that I can do at night when my spouse gets back from work.

I started my life having a lot of privilege and all the options for me and now at 24, I made all the wrong choices that led me to a dead end. 

I'm 24 years old and I'm screwed.

Sometimes I feel as though the world would be better if people like me were allowed to kill themselves...,"I guess this is the male version of the ""White Guilt"" concept. Basically, I feel like men like me are redundant: nice and polite, but insecure with survivor guilt and a chronic lack of motivation. Ten years of therapy, several psychiatrists, seven different medication regimens, and two diagnoses later, and I don't have any resilience toward life. I worked very hard in school, and I have the job I always wanted after almost twenty years of dragging myself through marriage, divorce, a masters degree, sleeping on my sibling's couch for four years, food stamps,... And I still feel like I'm just waiting for my bedtime every day, which is now. And I can't sleep.

So many men are like this. And I feel like a burden, just one more walking Y chromosome that makes a woman clutch her purse when I go past in the wrong time of night. I've tried working on my emotional intelligence and communicating, but I just feel like garbage that my mom shouldn't have invested so much time into. When she eventually passes away from her ailments, I'll only have two people in this world that make me feel obligated to keep living. One of whom has a chronic illness that will make it impossible for her to walk if left untreated ten years from now, and I won't be able to help pay for a  massive surgery. The other is my sibling. But he has a wife and a good life, and he shouldn't have to take that responsibility for keeping me motivated and alive.

I love my gf. But she is in so much pain... I wish she'd just get sick of me and find a guy who makes more money instead of agonizing and ""wondering if [she] really knows what she wants"" from life. She shouldn't have to do this. But she loves me, so she's committed to me. Me... This pudgy, whiny, burnt out, insecure, perpetually tired guy who has tried exercise and pills and talk and goals and everything else. I am inspired by women, who often have far more internal strength than I have. And I don't think I'll be getting that anytime soon. 

I just want my friends and family to mourn me and process my death so they can move on to other people to invest their emotions and time and resources. At least they actually are depressed when they have something that drives them. Me? I'm just a shell. Like a lot of sad-sack guys. I'm the kind of guy whose ""loss"" should be processed and properly forgotten. But that's not going to happen. So I'm stuck here.

spiraling into depression again,"i feel like i dont have anything to live for. i feel like just an observer of everything going on. i feel like im nothing. my family is messed up, i feel like i have no freedom like i always have to follow what people say and like i live for those people to control me and no matter what i do if it's against their wants i get punished it feels like prison it makes me so mad i never feel heard even if im being reasonable and it makes me want to hurt them or myself or just kill myself because of the frustration and anger. my body is not functioning like it used to making my life feel like hell everyday, my relationships are messed up, i have no friends, my mental health is shit. ive been thinking of killing myself again. im desperately trying to find anything to live for but there's none. sometimes it feels like the best solution to not exist",1
I have an anger problem,"And I hurt my best friend and soul mate because of it and now, because of my actions, I don't know if we'll continue on. 

I've been barely able to eat the past three days, i constantly feel nauseous, back is killing me suddenly, I can barely sleep (average 4-5 hours a night since Saturday) and I keep waking up drenched head to toe in sweat. I feel like the utmost horrible person that ever walked the earth. 

They have a medical condition, that when extremely stressed, can cause them to have to go to the hospital as it can be life or death. They have done nothing but treat me like a king and all I did was hurt them.

I'm starting online anger management courses tomorrow and going to get an appointment with a psychiatrist. Too little, too late right? I honestly don't know how I'll go on if I lose them. Not to sound dramatic. They set my soul on fire (in a good way). 

Im near 40 and have never met anyone who's made me feel so good and treated me so well.

I've admitted to them and family as well that I have an anger problem and need help and that I'm going to try my hardest to work on this. I also suffer from depression, anxiety, and have been diagnosed with bpd. 

They are going to decide tomorrow if they want to give me one more chance. I don't know if I can make it if they don't come back. I wouldn't blame them or hate them, I just don't know if I could continue on with my life.",1
Married and lost,"I’m so messed up 
I don’t even know how I got here… married 
I do care deeply for this amazing man and will never get better because there isn’t better 

I’m still in love with someone else ….I hate myself for it 
I hate myself for this life I’m in 
I should be thriving and happy recently married but I constantly think about running away just going to a new state changing my name not telling anyone …saying nothing just completely new 
But I can’t 
I wake up , tell my husband “I love you , have a good day” but all I want is to get in my car a drive 
State line after state line and just end up somewhere 
I want to feel 
Something has to make me really feel 
I am so numb",1
I am toxic,"I am just a toxic person to myself and to those I spend a lot of time with. I cannot have a healthy relationship, let alone think about getting married and spending my life with someone. I have a girlfriend now that I feel I’ve gotten so used to I just get so annoyed so easily of her and honestly it’s not her fault. It’s mine. Im a piece of shit toxic person and this happens with every person I get too close with. Until I moved on my own, my mom and I would fight and I would just say horrible things to both her and my father. Same with my brother when we would get into fights as kids. I’m like a drug. I’m nice at first but the longer you take me and the more of me you take, the more toxic I become. I really just feel like I should be alone and be a bachelor. I’m hopeless and I should not let anyone get too close for theirs and my sake. Thanks for coming to my sad life.",1
second day being defeated by my depression,"Today was incredibly hard for me, so was yesterday. I can't fight off intrusive thoughts. I'm disassociated and can't continue going about my day. I'm fighting hard so I forced myself to drive one hour north to the trails but that made me feel only worse for wasting gas, the sun was so heavy and I got a ticket for going over the speed limit. I asked my mom to sleep over, she's visiting me to help me move out of my apartment (moving back with her until March) but she can't stay all night.

I really don't want to be alone. I called my friend but she would not stop talking about herself, I forgot she can't be there for others which she doesn't owe me anything, she's just doing her thing. It was a ten minute phone call of her talking the entire time (I'm not exaggerating). I had to end it for my well being when I had a chance to say something without interupting her. I'm not in the right place to be listening to her. I'm not present and need to vent to someone. I need to just explode about what's going on inside my head. 

Tonight I am with my dog and I am enjoying her company but I can't do anything to help myself. I haven't rock climbed in a week, I haven't ran in a few days. I have a job interview Wednesday, it's technical programming interview and I know I won't get the job because I haven't coded in MONTHS. I'm confident I won't know how to answer their questions. I have the worst imposter syndrome and performance anxiety, I can't sound confident for the life of me. 

Unfortunately I am recovering from a traumatizing relationship with my ex. I'm pursuing a relationship with a better man but I can't help but think it's temporary because I'm in the reserves military and I'm only in this state until March, when I enter active duty. Nobody cares for a LDR especially if they're just starting to get to know eachother, especially someone who will be deployed a shit load of times. It's a career I'm not willing to compromise though. I want this. 

My point is, I'm recovering, feeling lonely, lost, disappointed in myself and so fucking hopeless. I want to feel loved, I want a family and I want stability. I especially want these intrusive thoughts to get the fuck out.

I know this won't be happening but I daydream that my ex realizes how abusive he is and gets a fucking therapist. I wish he would reach out to me, tell me he is getting better and he doesn't want me out of his life, that he misses me and proves he is well rounded. The reality is though this is too good to be true and I'm so fucking trauma bonded to him. I should never be with him again so why do I want us to be together??? I need to move on and I'm trying but it's so damn hard when my life is on standby until March.",1
Regerts,"I kinda regret going to the hospital. I feel less suicidal  than I was before I went in, but I'm still miserable and now I don't even have the drive to kill myself so I'm just going to suffer for who knows how long before the meds eventually stop working. I keep flip-flopping between ""I want to get better"" and ""I want to die"" and it's fucking confusing.",1
why am i like this?,"i really did my best, i did everthing i was told, take care if myself, eat healthy, do regular walking, do regular workout to keep myself energetic, distanced myself from toxic people, pcik up few hobbies that i can enjoy, read books........

What is the point,"Gotta say I don't know what the point of my life is anymore.
I get up, go to work, come home, eat sleep, do it again. Get through the weekend.

Fuck knows what the point is.

I'm not young, I don't have kids. I get to watch my dad live his pointless life since my mum died 2 years ago.
None of my siblings are into anything I am so if I visit them I am a bit bored because we don't have anything except family in common.

If (and I think spirituality this is what happens)  I chose this for myself, I wish to fuck I knew why.
Did I choose to be alone bored and lost?
Jeez....

I'm not going to end it, but I get why people do. It's fucking awful.",1
Feels like I'm worthless and wished didn't exist.,"Listen to me,
Ever had all of these dreams and goals as you were growing up?. Well unfortunately I did. But now I'm at a point in life where all the dreams I had doesn't coincide with the future I'm looking at. A point where everything has come to a standstill. I don't wanna die and I'm not going to kill myself, but since yesterday I wanted to stop existing. I feel like everyone is going to mock me when they find out what happened. How I wasted my life, trying to chase a dream. Cause that's all it was, a dream. But unfortunately it is time to wake up. And realize that ""hope"" only brings pain in the long run. I wish the world ended today, right now. FML.",1
Does this sadness ever go away?,"Drowning in self pity. My thoughts are self destructive. I just want to disappear, possible never wake up. I want out. Why do I struggle so much? I don’t like myself, I don’t like how I’m closed off to family. I’m so behind in life. I really hope I don’t make it past 30, I’m not having a good time. I feel like I hit a brick wall, and I’m just staring at it, unable to move, paralyzed and dragged by the past, and too anxious about the future. I don’t think this gets better. I feel like a burden. I’ve been therapist shopping for a while but no luck. I might just cry myself to sleep tonight. I woke up today wishing I handn’t. I fell asleep last night wishing I wouldn’t wake up today. I think I might need some prescribed  medication but I’m scared to take them. I’m afraid it’s the only way to feel “normal”. I feel so incredibly low. I’ve given up on life. Life is dull, what meaning does it have. I feel like a leaf drifting the wind, lifeless, no care in the world. I wish I could just be confident, not worry about what everyone thinks, not be sensitive, not be a crybaby, not be a mess, not be quiet/shy/reserved, not be self pyting(even when I’m trying not to), not be a Debby downer all the time, not be a loner, not be angry with myself, and not be me. Cuz being me is unlikeable, unapproachable, and lame. I don’t like me, I’m too sensitive, I’ve always been even when I was a kid and I’ve always felt judged because of it. It sucks being in your head. I can’t run away from myself, I wish I was someone else.",1
Im so fckn empty,"All of my friends make jokes about me because im a virgin im fighting since years with a big lonely feeling if this feeling continue i didnt think that i made it to my 18th birthday fuck my life

My eldest daughter isn’t biologically mine , which makes this so much worse for me, I stepped to be her father figure , why do I keep letting her down because of my addiction? 

Don’t get me wrong I don’t drink during the day , I only let loose when my two girls are gone to bed.

Can anyone help ?",1
DAE feel happy for/jealous of people who died?,"i know it sounds twisted, but i recently started noticing that now whenever I watch movies or videos where a person has died and everyone is getting sad in the comments, I no longer think “wow that’s sad and awful”, I think “that’s great, they no longer have to suffer anymore, both now and in the future”

and then i lowkey get jealous as i return to my miserable laborious existence of just trying to do daily living

I just wanna talk,Hello. It's been a long time since I actually talked about my life to someone. I have some friends but I feel ashamed to talk to them about my life. I've been feeling terrible since I started uni. Thought this bad feeling would go away as I grow up but it never did. I just graduated and now I am getting ready for an exam so I can get work as a teacher. (That's how it works in my country). I don't know what's wrong with me but I can't even study somedays just because I feel so shitty. I don't usually go out and I'm always at the computer. And I think my health has been getting worse and worse. I think I have hemoroids as well but I'm scared to go to the doctor. I don't even get excited for stuff I used to love and adore. There are positive things happening in my life and I'm sure I would've been super excited if these things were happening a few years ago. I just feel so tired and even eating doesn't make me happy anymore. I just get up study all day and go back to sleep. I just feel tired I don't wanna wake up anymore. Just bored of everything. Always scared to make people not wanna be friends with me anymore. And I feel like people around me don't like me for some reason. I know I have a good family and I know they love me but I feel like I can never talk to them about stuff like this. I always thought about going to therapist but I don't think I can afford it. I don't expect find a solution here. I just wanted to talk. Sorry if I made you feel bad.,1
Fighting the Urge,Currently fighting the urge to kill myself right now. I can't do it in a place where my girlfriend will find me....,1
I want to die but I am not planning on killing myself nor do I intend to,"I want to die. But I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to not exist anymore, but I just don't want to exist in this way. I've had a terribly hard few months and no one is here to help me. I need to not be awake. I need to not hear the constant cacophony inside my head. I need to be at peace and I’m not going to get that here, but I don't know where to get it from. 

 I've been dealing with bad hypochondria and germophobia since I got COVID. I got through COVID fine. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I'm really grateful that it wasn't so bad. But the mental recovery since it all happened has been way more difficult and that is something I hadn't anticipated.

It is mental torture. I wake up each day not wanting to be awake. I wake up each day hoping it will be okay and immediately realising that it cannot be. I wake up each day hating my body and hating the skin that I am forced to inhabit. I feel so trapped and I can’t find a way to break free. 

I’m sitting here bawling my eyes out and no one is here to help me. I’m not allowed to show weakness because I am supposed to be the pillar. A break in the foundation compromises the entire structure. I am supposed to be well and content because that is what is required. How do I get well again? 

I cannot get comfortable in my own space. I behave like an absolute lunatic and I don’t even fucking care. I don’t care about anything.  

I want a moment to shut off, to not give a shit. I just don’t want to care. The less I care, the easier this becomes. But I have never know how not to care. I always give a shit about too many things that don’t need a second thought. It is not easy to just throw it all away. The worries don’t disappear. 

They become louder and louder the more I try to ignore them. They shout, scream and bounce around in my head with greater rapidity the more I try to refute them. So how do I stop it? I can’t stop it by myself. I can’t weather the storm. I can’t because I am not strong enough for this. I’m not strong right now, and I haven’t been for a while. 

I just feel so broken. Every day takes a little away from me and it leaves me crumbling, weak. I can’t explain this to anyone. They can see me struggling. They see me hurting too. All you have to do is look at my hands to see the extent of the damage. 

I don't know how to be okay again and I am desperately hoping, praying that it happens for me. But I am in so much pain and I don't even know why. I don't even know how I became this person.",1
Codepency & the Depressing Cycles it Makes,"I have been on and off with my girlfriend of 4 years these last few months as we have been having constant issues and I just feel so depressed about continuing making the same mistake of getting with someone who doesn't care about me anymore just because I still feel love, want my best friend and have so much tied to the life we built. I absolutely still have feelings for my ex and the period where we were separate before trying it again all feels undone and I feel hopeless. I started pitching in for bills because it all seemed to be working and it just got bad these last couple weeks and it feels like I am back to nothing. I had a place to stay before our first split and now I don't, I have a job I make alright money with, but not being able to stay anywhere since we shared a place is just painful. I just wish I didn't feel binded to codependency and didn't fall for someone who is treating me like a yo-yo in their life.",1
Knives,"I kinda wish I had my knives back now, but at the same time, I don't want to make a mess when I die. Don't want to inconvenience people any more than I have to.",1
Kind of jealous of other people dying (vent),"I guess it started in 2015, after I lost my best friend to a ruptured appendix... I still wish I could swap places with him, I feel like he wasn't supposed to die. I see his grave as mine. He had so many more reasons to keep living. Why the hell am I still here and he isn't?

And now I'm feeling that same intense feeling again after this guy that lives next door to my workplace passed away from a heart attack. He was gone before he even knew it. He's got two little kids, man. And he was young! He was in his early 40's.

I'm not suicidal (currently), I just feel like I'm not of much use to this world. I'm literally just floating through life without a purpose, why can't I take the place of someone who actually has one? I mean, if you commit suicide it's seen as the coward's way out and that you'll end up in hell, so some people will resent you when you're gone. But dying from something else? It's tragic, it's sad and people will mourn you because you couldn't help it.

I'm just... So tired. I don't want to live my life anymore, I feel like I'm so insignificant.",1
I need to stop drinking when I am alone at night,"When I drink alcohol at late hours, sad thoughts just creep in me like right now. I'm alone and sometimes I feel like it will remain that way no matter what good advices I see or what ""breakthrough"" I feel in my life. Sometimes I think about these things normally, but it feels intensified under certain conditions like now. What I really want is love I guess. Love that fills the void of loneliness. But sometimes I also think ""What if my desire for love is selfish?"" I don't want to have that deep connection with someone if its one sided, at least that's what I tell myself but its possible for things to end up that way even if I don't acknowledge it. Yet at the same time I just really want that comfort more than anything in the world. I want a deep relationship where the feelings absolutely mutual. I just can't reach it and chances are I'll have to live with that.",1
I feel extremely depressed and lonely.,I  just found out my Aunt passed away very early this morning. It hit me really hard and I honestly have nobody to share my true feelings with. I'm really a sorry case. I'm a grown ass man with a license and a library card but I literally have no friends. As I'm crying typing this. I just wish I had someone to look forward to.....   Besides looking forward to MY time!  I know there's gotta be a better life! Or is it wishful thinking?,1
I never imagined my future after highschool/stuff on my mind,"I recently graduated about 2 weeks ago, I've been applying at fast food places and just following what my parents want. All I've wanted was to finish school and get to this point in my life. But I can't find a career that I want and I've just been a couch potato. The only thing I'm focused on is a friend that I like, they saved my prom night, and make me feel great. But I get self conscious and think negative thoughts she might have about me. I cope with food, my health is fine but it may get worse. I'm closed off from mostly everyone and it's just routine for me. At the end of the day I'd like just spill my feelings to my friend, go west to L.A. and just wait on the beach until I eventually deteriorate. I'm supressing something from my mind as once I start to realize how pathetic I've been I just tear up. Until I watch or eat something...",1
Sensitive?,"I would of never realized that I’d come to a point in my life where when I look around me, everyone seems to be happier than me. They seem to show off their relationships, they’re happy being with me but I feel guilty I can’t express the same energy

I’m super depressed, I’m told I can only help myself

How should I do this…",1
A series of short and incoherent ramblings.,"I miss enjoying things. I miss playing through video games all the way and loving it. I miss reading books, and enjoying personal projects. I miss life before I was depressed, and yet I would not trade the worldview I have now to get it back.

Having depression is rough enough. ADHD just drives the stake deeper. I have so many hobbies and yet I feel as if I don't enjoy any of them. It's like having a library filled with great books and only wanting to watch movies. I wish that I could talk to a therapist but I'm so worried about doing so. It seems terrifying. What if I say the wrong thing and they end up never taking me seriously? What if I'm hospitalized?

This leads me to my last questions. What if I'm faking it? What if I'm a fraud? What if they find out? 

I'm sorry if this post seems a little unhinged. I feel like melting.",1

That way no one would've had to waste resources on me.",1
I have no one,Every time I try to talk to family members about being lonely they don’t understand as they have lots of friends to speak to but I have no one and cry everyday I’ve already attempted to overdose 2 weeks ago and I wish it acc worked as life is painfully boring and it hurts seeing people live a normal life and I wonder what’s so wrong with me,1
Im tired of living but can’t end it,"Im 22, struggled with depression since I was a kid due to a messed up childhood. I’ve had 2 huge heartbreaks that has done further damage to my heart and head, my last relationship was the first time in my life I have felt fundamentally happy, day to day I was joyful and content with life. That relationship ended in a bad way, I was emotionally abused, I lost my career and friends from it. I now barely have any friends, struggle more than ever to push my self to work, I no longer have any feeling in my heart, I’m numb and won’t be able to love again, if I can’t love again I don’t think my heart will ever heal.

I’ve decided that I’d rather not struggle anymore, I’m sure you can relate that it is like torture. I had already decided I’m ready to go subconsciously but didn’t even realise, I no longer care when I drive recklessly and have no fear, I no longer have any health anxiety which I’ve always had, I don’t care about anything, so subconsciously I am ready to go.

Every time I go to sleep there’s part of me that hopes I don’t wake up, I never look forward to a day or am glad that I’ve woken.

I am ready, but why can’t I do it? I Haven’t tried, I just can’t.. I drive dangerously hoping in the back of my head I might crash, I mix drugs hoping something goes wrong, but I just can’t end it myself. I don’t know why and I wish I could. I’m so tired

You can only be told that things will get better so many times before you lose hope. Can only be told so many times that time heals, it’s hard to believe when the pain gets worse day by day.

Currently sat in my car crying as I do often, thinking of how I can do it, but I know I’ll never be able to. Why?",1

It's been years and he still gives me suicidal urges,"It's a long story. I was born into an abusive family. In school I was beaten, ostracized, spat on, made fun of 24/7. I had no friends and the friends I thought I had weren't real friends. They would bully me literally all the time. Through all of that, I found a guy who actually loved me and cared about me in a way no one ever did. He paid attention to me and talked to me like I'm a human being and not a sickly unsightly monster, which no guy had ever done before. I'd been treated like shit by nearly everyone in my poor miserable life, and suddenly there's this nice, aloof guy, whom I fully expected to treat me like shit as per usual, and instead he talks to me, comforts me, and actually listens to me and enjoys my company. He was my only reason to live but now that I've lost him I just don't see a point in living anymore. The thoughts of being with him were literally the only thing that kept me going. He was my soulmate. The love of my life. My first ever friend and my only friend I've had until now. He was like a cool glass of water to a girl dying of thirst. I can't accept that I'll never get to be with him. I'm getting uglier with age and I'm experiencing hair loss. I'm just this walking pile of repulsive barf. I literally go crazy when I think about him and his future gf/wife. I can't see him living my dreams with another woman. I hate that I'm ugly and can't do shit about it. What's even the fucking point of life if you're too ugly for anything? I'll never have him. I am so FUCKING ugly. I have multiple incurable diseases. I have no friends. I hate people. I hate myself.

He's now living life with a bunch of beautiful looking people and I'm here in my room crying over him and rotting away day by day. Is there any reason to live?",1

also the part where >!evelyn said she'd still be with joy in every universe in every way!< may appeal to most people, but it doesn't change the fact that we're all still being forced to live miserable lives in a miserable society. at the end of the day, truly *nothing really matters*",1
Why do I still care?,"I'm aware that life is meaningless but why do I still feel offended when someone insults and criticize me? I cringed or feel irritated whenever someone state or do something that I disagree, why do I still have values?

Born just to be institutionalized to a traditional education system you don't like, after all that gruesome coercion only to face another oppression by slaving away the rest of your life entirely for food and shelter? Sounds like heaven for me.

Even life before modern society isn't any better either, a lazy bum like me doesn't deserve to live.

I need to accept that I am depressed.,"I don't want to be broken, I don't want to ask for help, I don't want to be overdramatic, I don't want to see a psychologist, i don't want to be told to take medication. Yet at the same time when I look through the symptoms of depression on WebMD and on creditable yourube channels (like medcircle) I relat eto so many of the red flags of severe depression like fatigue, self doubt, inward directed anger (I'll never be good enough, what's the point, ext.), lack of joy, ect. Furthermore, when I talk to my family about depression they suggest that I may have it becuase they observe many of these aforementioned things within me. I don't want to admit that I'm broken, becuase it's a lot of work, becuase I don't see how my life could be different, becuase I'll have to change my life style. There's still a part of me that knows that I could have a better life. I'm only 23 years old. I need to grasp onto that thread of hope. I need to go to a psychologist. Depression cannot continue to rule my life, becuase if it does I won't have much more life to live.",1
Confused,Has anyone ever felt like they’re faking their sad emotions when they’re sad ?,1
I watched Fantastic Fungi last night and…,"Sooo, for those who have haven’t watched this amazing documentary, is on Netflix and it will blow your mind. For those who have; my question is… have any of you ever tried psychedelics to treat depression and anxiety? Has it worked? What was your method? I’m sick of depression I’ve been dealing with it way too long, I have tried EVERYTHING. These people claim only one dose will make you feel better for weeks, WEEKS! I’m deadass about to go hunting for magic mushrooms in the wild 😅 enlighten me please!",1
I don’t want to get better,"I don’t know how to said it, I wish I weren’t depressed for sure, but do I exercise? No

Do I eat right and get enough sunlight? No

Is my test low? Yes
Do I want to do the work to improve it? No

Am I broke? Yes
Do I put in more effort to get more money? Nope 

Do I want to? Deep down it seems not, or else I would have right?

What’s wrong with me and why am I so hopeless? Everything feels so empty and so pointless, every second I’m alive I experience a new level of sadness I hadn’t yet conceived of and I can’t bare it, there are so many things that need done yet I just… can’t… do it…",1
can someone answer a question for me,"So I'll go straight to the point I've got a lot good things in my life a happy wife, friends , a great job ,a great life now but honestly I just want to die don't know why , growing up always told you have to have a reason for everything but why am I not happy when I should be?

Does life have meaning?,"Lately I've been been feeling hopeless and so alone and lonely even though there are people around me like my parents, colleagues etc but i just feel alone and feel like life has no meaning for me. All i do is work 9-10 hours a day at a retail store, standing there while all my colleagues just talk to each other and ignoring me 🙃
I've been thinking even if i just quit from the job like now no one will noticed and I wouldn't matter. Even if die now, I don't think anyone will bother to call/text to ask me anything until the news comes up the next day stating im dead.",1
my dog passed away today,"My dog passed away today

"i have always been alone because i wanted to, but now I'm starting to feel alone...","My entire youth i've never had many friends, and to be honest, i never cared about having a lot of friends, going out with them or something like this, because i am a very introverted person. But now i have finished school, i'm starting to feel extremely alone...

As i've already said, i finished school, and now i live locked in my room everyday, while i see my ex classmates going out and having fun together, and this is starting to make me feel completely alone.

I know it's a silly problem, and i need to learn how to get used to the loneliness because the adult's life is basically this. (just to clears i'm 17.)

Now i spend my days doing nothing except music, drawing and studying english (i live in a third world country, which is hard to make money enough to live just of art, and english isn't my mother's language) while i wait for a job to fall down from heaven, because i'm too shy to go out and look for a job.

i know it's a silly problem, i am just 17, but it's starting to make me feel extremely sad and alone, i hope things change as soon as possible.

anyways, thank you for reading my vent, and sorry for any mistake, as i said before english is not my first language.

i hope we all have a great day, even though we are complete strangers, i love you who read this!

Feel so lonely at night,"I am already lonely during the day, have barely any friends and people that try to become my friend, I inadvertently push away. And then when nighttime rolls around I just end up looking at my phone until I am tired enough to fall asleep and then I wake up in the morning just to do hardly anything all day. My dream is to be able to just chill somewhere with some chill people where I can talk about whatever I want and people understand me without judgement.. just a vent",1
Passing out in depression,my loved one has been getting dizzy spells and fainted a few times. She suffers from depression and is in bed all day. I think it’s because she lies down all day so getting up too fast causes these issues. Can anyone let me know if this happens in depressive state?,1
My life has been an absolute catastrophe. And I’m OK with that.,"My deprivation of positive experience has become unspeakable. But I guess not everybody gets to have nice things. It’s ok, though. I’ll be a martyr for everyone else so they don’t repeat the same errors that have plagued my life. I’ll be a sacrifice for the common good. I will be kind to others and raise awareness so others can have joy and happiness. But for me, I won’t ever get to experience it. I guess it’s asking too much.",1

I’m so exhausted,"Im 19 and I have been severely depressed for a month. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am Unable to sleep alone, losing weight because I’m not eating, sleeping all day, crying all day, extreme anxiety, racing thoughts. I also get really bad derealization when my depression gets bad. My mom has had to take off work because I mentally can’t be alone. I recently went to the hospital because of an extreme anxiety attack. I’m not sure how I made it through it honestly. My psychiatrist hasn’t answered in weeks. I’m pretty sure I had a mild case of serotonin syndrome because I had all of the less extreme symptoms. My psychiatrist had me on Cymbalta and lithium for months and then Prozac and lithium. I have since switched doctors and was made aware of the possibility of serotonin syndrome. I am now taking Wellbutrin and am just wondering how long it’s gonna take to notice a difference. Im so scared and I really don’t have hope. I fear that even once it gets better that this may happen again. My mom has been on Wellbutrin and Lexapro for around 16 years and it has been a life saver. I’ve heard that if something works for a family member it may work for you. My depression has only gotten this bad 2 other times which was around age 10 and 13. We believe the cause of one of those times was serotonin syndrome again or just a horrible reaction to Zoloft. I also was in the process of getting tms last month but could no longer go to my treatments because of how bad I felt. I have tried over 15 different medications but nothing seems to last for more then a couple years. I just wanna know there is hope. Please let me know if you guys have any recommendations because I don’t know what else to do.",1

I don't know how or when to ask for help.,"I'm not sure if it is because of how I was raised, my autism, or a bit of both. 

I struggled a lot with my mental health for a bunch of years now and I just realized that I don't know how to ask for help. 

I lost one of the most precious friendships I've ever had because 1 my mum didn't like him and 2 when I was at my lowest I got mad at him for not helping me when I needed him but thinking about it now, I never asked for help. 

I don't know how to do it and if I knew I don't know when to ask for it unless I'm at my absolute limit, I hate it so much because unless I'm debating on doing really serious stuff I don't realize I need help.",1
Barely having any privacy during therapy appointments is so frustrating,"I feel like no one in my family understands how important therapy is to me. I don’t get why no one wants to make sure that I have privacy and that I am comfortable. 

Today I rescheduled an appointment for next Friday because my own room wasn’t a private place by the time the appointment was about to start. The family computer isn’t far away from my bedroom door so the family member using it would have heard everything I said. That makes me uncomfortable. I was told to just close the door but that doesn’t help.

I ran downstairs to try and find somewhere else but failed. I looked dumb doing this. 😭 And no one seemed to care about how I felt.

I’m always portrayed as the one who doesn’t care about how everyone else feels.. which isn’t true.

It’s upsetting to me that I don’t have that privacy. Why do I have to scramble around to get privacy because no one around me cares if I’m uncomfortable or not?

This is just another reason to add to why this week sucks. I cried so much and I might cry again after this. I’m just tired of being frustrated and stressed.",1
Im 19 and I’m going to kill my self now I’m at a cliff and going to jump,"Im at a cliff and going to jump. I'm 19 years old, and I've let my life fall apart. I moved from being an excellent student with good grades who was confident in my abilities to feeling uneasy and apprehensive. had so much potential, but I let self-doubt sabotage everything and still continue to do. Now I think about people my age get accepted to their dream schools and pursue their dreams while I can't even see my own future. I feel envy thinking of people my age who are socialising, making friends, and pursuing their dreams in school. I've destroyed myself and will continue to trash my life. I'm still lost on what I want to do with my life. I felt like I was making significant progress in my life to improve it, but now I'm back on this sub, having problems with myself family, and it's all sliding downhill again. I'm not sure what I should do to be happy, and even though I have things, I still feel like something is lacking. I don't have much to keep me going, except from false dreams and fantasies of my life getting better, and I honestly believe that death is a better place than living as myself.
While everyone at my age has decided out what they want to do with their lives, I'm restricted to my room, playing video games, watching TV/movies, and reading books. I'm worried that as I get older, I won't be able to keep up. Because of my insecurity, I squandered so much potential. Now, I believe that others my age are admitted into the schools of their dreams and realise their ambitions, but I am not one of them. I am unable to imagine my fate. just be a fool. Because it's the only thing I know how to do, I destroyed myself and I will continue to destroy my life. I’m crippled with this self hatred for myself the way I look talk everything what causes me to have anxiety at everything I do to make it better by trying to make friends and maybe meet someone but I end up failing or just not doing it. But I don't see myself changing, I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing that has become crippling, along with my anxiety, to the point that I can't even leave the house to do the things I have planned. maybe it will get better, maybe not if I does I’ll like to look back at these posts and see far I’ve come, but i keep thinking of killing my self rather than living in a life I constantly hate and my self.",1
Depression,"I have a lot in my mind and different browsers that are all running at the same time, so I will write it all down. It’s so hard to keep going. Having to put an act then projecting that personality in public. Others are aware that you’re faking it but putting myself in their shoes: I wouldn’t know how to help me either. Because I can’t. I think depression is a personal thing an individual fights internally. Their environment also plays along with their moods. So to be better there needs to be CHANGE right? But how does one overcome the fears of change? 

I have another on my mind: awareness. I can start a fight if I wanted to, then randomly end it. Idk how it got this bad, I know it may sound psychotic, but I believe I use that mechanism to be HEARD. A cry for HELP. But in the back of my mind I question, it’s very manipulative? 


Final thought: What makes a person them? Their issues I mean. 

Is a narcissist born or are they made? Is a bipolar born or are they made? How does one get diagnosed as depression? Why do we feel anxious?  

If someone to diagnose as a such things listed above, does that truly make us that ‘sickness’? 

Do I have depression? I think so? I am sad, but I am so aware

Just a lot of my mind",1
I hate hope,"Hope keeps me alive, only for me to be disappointed. I hate false hope, I hate there being shreds of hope. It makes me want to stay alive and see. See if a miracle will save me or I’ll just get my act together. But the answer is no. Fuck me. Fuck hope. And fuck life.",1
No more,I shouldn't HAVE to live for someone else and it pisses me off that I do. I want to either get well or fucking die. No more of this in-between shit.,1
Is anyone else angry at people caring about them and keeping them alive? (Rant),"I'm so angry at the people who care about me. I hate that they'd be upset if I died or if I sh. I know that they'd start walking on eggshells if I opened up about it again and that that's as far as their care for me would go. I'd forever be uncomfortable around them, but I wouldn't get any support in return. But I know that they'd be upset if I died. It's bullshit. It's bull bc I know that I would ruin my family if I yeeted, but I can't get help from the people who are forcing me to live, and I'm struggling too much to save myself. It's like I'm being waterboarded by the people I love. 

And I'm so mad bc they could have kept me from turning out like this. There were so many opportunities for them to reach out and support me but they chose not to because they didn't care enough. 

I'm so fucking angry that they make me feel guilty for feeling the way that they caused me to feel.  I have been going thru this suffering for fucking years and even when I actually begged for help, no one took me seriously or gave enough of a crap to do anything. And now I have to care about their feelings when deciding what to do with my own life. 

My parents could have nipped this in the bud in my early years or even when I first flat out told them that I was struggling but they fucking didn't. And now that I'm an adult who can legally get help on my own, I just want to die. I don't want to get better, I just want to stop suffering and I want the fastest, easiest way to do that. I just want to finally have some fucking peace and these people are keeping it from me. 

I was forced to come to life because of other people and those same people are forcing me to keep living through the hell that they knew they were bringing me into. I daydream of them not caring about me at all so that I can do what I want without guilt.",1
Need help and guidance,"Hello brothers and sisters. I am in mid 20s and have a serious question . How do you all overcome the feeling of sadness when nothing good is happening in life. Many of my colleagues are way ahead of me academically. I feel scared thinking whether I will ever be successful. Also, my health has deteriorated in past few months. Pain in legs and fatigue. I even went to doctor but tests are normal. I feel easily irritated nowadays. I don't know what to do. On the top of it, there are family problems and fights which make me even more sad and lonely.

I do my prayers but somewhere there is fear and tension. I also once got angry on God that why he is not guiding me to overcome health, academic and family problems. Since it is mentioned that God always helps his devotees. But here , I always feel like things are becoming worse and there is no light. Initially, I thought it is a test from him. But now i feel hopeless not knowing what to do and how to get out of this. No one is supportive and disregards my condition here. It feels like time is going off and I am stuck.",1

Im depressed and i only get the feeling of validation that im really depressed when i do self-harm,"Ive been depressed for quite a while but unlike others, i dont do self harm on my body because im also obsessed on being pretty. Its because of my past trauma, i want to be be pretty as much as possible so i dont hurt my physical self. Except today, i feel like im gonna explode and i need some release and then i get a blade and start cutting myself. Its a exhilarating feeling, i feel validated. I feel like im not just faking my depression. Although My father just saw my self harm today and said i should just pray and just told me i was a coward.

My drinking addiction,"I’m currently drunk off my nut so I feel like this is a perfect time to get this off my chest.

I have 2 beautiful daughters and girlfriend which I love very much. My drinking has really gotten out of control. I’m never drunk around 2 daughters. I really kick start my drinking when they go to bed. 

I could drink a bottle of whiskey in one night with no problem.

I really feel like I have no option left but to kick the stool and let my kids live their life without an alcoholic father

My depression comes out of nowhere. It doesn't stop and I'm exhausted,"I don't understand where it comes from. If anyone saw a movie about my life, they'd say I had it all. I was born to my parents, who were married when they had me, I was planned, I was loved as a child, I went to private schools my whole life, I got to go abroad at a very young age... Of course not everything has been perfect. Of course I've had some bad moments but I feel like they're nothing compared to what other people have written on this sub, or what other people in my life have told me about their lives. 

For the longest time, I've just felt this huge void inside of me. My parents have always supported me in my creative pursuits and hobbies but somehow nothing feels that void. I have very low self esteem and I don't understand why. I have an inherent belief that I am worthless, that I am not good enough, that no one understands. I go into everything thinking I won't be any good, that I'm never going to accomplish anything, despite being, for the most part, supported and loved. I feel like an impostor. I feel like I don't deserve any of what I have. I empathize heavily with people. They tell me about their lives and I feel like I've had it  easier, and that makes me feel sick about myself. I don't tell anyone about my problems cause I feel like they'll dismiss me and say ""Those aren't real problems"". Like I said, my life isn't perfect, but it's much better than others'. Yet I feel sad all the time, like something is missing. Not only do I feel sad, but I feel guilty about being sad, cause I know there's people who have had it a lot rougher. 

I don't know what it is. I've always felt different, in school I never fit in with my peers, nobody liked the things I liked, I have always been very sensitive, and being a man, I learned to hide that very quickly, as I realized society wanted men to be tough. I never liked sports or videogames like the rest of my classmates. I always felt left out. My family are engineers, hence why money was never a problem for me. My grandfather always insisted for me, his first-born grandchild to become an engineer and continue with the family business. I was never good at math or science, I always felt like a failure. My parents spent a lot of money sending me to one of my country's best high-schools. It is very science-biased. All my classmates wanted to become engineers, or businessmen or stock brokers. No one took me seriously with my more artistic pursuits and abilities, I always felt out of place. I was always lonely.

I fell in love with someone. It didn't last long. Her life has definitely been harder than mine and I couldn't help but to empathize with her. It also made me feel like such an idiot. There's people out there with genuine problems, and here I am complaining about feeling lonely and out of place. I know I shouldn't minimize my feelings, but I'm also not sure if the sadness and emptiness I feel are justified by my life experience, which has been  objectively very good. I just have been feeling sad and empty for as long as I can remember, and it doesn't go away. I think very little of myself and I think I'm my own worst enemy.",1

I don’t want to live. I have nothing. I’m probably too weak to even kill myself. I cant go on much longer. Nobody cares. And in the end I feel pathetic for posting this on reddit where Nobody Will care either. I try so hard everyday. I cant take it anymore. Nobody Will ever truly care for me. I feel like Im trash.

Anyone else have these weird depression episodes that last like a day?,"It probably isn’t depression because I’m 13 and other people have it harder, idek what it is and I cant explain how it feels because it’s so overwhelming just trying to think about it. It goes like this, I’ll cry so hard to the point where I’m violently vomiting, self harming or gasping for air at night, it doesn’t happen frequently it’s only when something bad happens. I’ll cry or do something I said up there^ and the next morning I’ll be happy and all upbeat, like what is this??? I’m so tired of it

I don’t know if this is normal,"I recently got a girlfriend and I’ve been the happiest I’ve been in a very long time. We’re long distance which is hard, but she made me feel like I was wanted and needed in this world. 
But the other week she said she didn’t like the way I talked to other girls and I was heartbroken from that statement. I would never do anything to harm her or make her feel unwanted or discarded.

However it was what she did next that broke me. She blocked me on everything, every social media, the video games we played together. I couldn’t contact her at all. I was crying my eyes out for the first time in around 8 years. I was completely broken and there was no way of talking to her again. It felt like I just lost the one thing that saved me from my pit of darkness. 

Later on that day she unblocks me on Instagram to let me talk with her. I tried to get answers out of her to see what I had done wrong and why she had done it. She sounded dead toned and bored almost as I was crying to get her not to leave. She said she’d give me another go but looking back at it, I’m not sure whether that was normal in other relationships. She seems detached and I feel like I can’t love her the same anymore. I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do",1

I lost in the game called life.,"This is my 1st redit so I don't know how it works, but I got to tell someone.
I'm an 18 year old man without friends. I had friends till the 8th grade, that's when my parents divorced and my marks got really bad because of that and of my addiction to videogames to equalize the depressions. I had to go to another school where I knew a few people, but they weren't really nice to me. I had 1 friend till I graduated and after that this person rarely texted me back. I still have 1 friend from the time on my old school, but we hardly see each other because we live further apart and neither of us has a car and bus/ train system is a mess in our region. Last year in september I started my training as an industrial mechanic at a pretty good company. Earn a lot of money and I save up like 85% of it and I still buy most things I want, but whatever it is that I buy it won't keep me happy for more than a few hours. I would love to meet new friends, but because of the addiction to video games I lost contact to all of my friends exapt that 1, I got chubby and unattractive and I got afraid of social contact with strangers. It's even hard for me to talk to old classmates or even look them in the eyes. I don't think anyone will read this, but if you did read it and you have some advice besides a dictionary for my bad english, then let me know.",1
So lost in my head.,"I don’t know what to do anymore . I feel like my depression is just getting worse to the point where I don’t care if I see another day or not. regardless of all the loved ones I leave behind which is selfish but I feel like I would be at peace ….
I could have the  best day ever but when I get
Home alone I just cry cry cry cry.
I hate talking about my struggles with other because they either see it as negativity in their life or feel like they will think I’m weak minded 
I can’t talk to my family . If
You knew my family you would understand.

Everyday I try to picture my future I just see nothing.
Because I just feel like I won’t be here.",1
I just have nothing to feel anymore,"For months I haven't talked to any friends much, for weeks I haven't posted on here much, I just have nothing to day anymore, no energy to feel anymore. I can't keep feeling pain it just doesn't matter enough anymore. Just numb. I don't want to listen to music or play video games anymore. I thought I was doing better becuase I was contemplating life, but I just don't care for anything anymore, when you contemplate existing its becuase you know or want something more... I guess I just feel defeat not a shocking one, just one without end.",1
i’m not meant for this world.,"since my last entry i have made significant steps to try and improve my life in an effort to try to continue existing for the few people that seem to care if i stick around. unfortunately none of these positive changes have made any difference. i’ve come to the realization that i do not belong or have what it takes to exist in society as it is. we live in a world that values greed, power and control over over genuine care for our fellow man and the state of the earth. humanity is headed for even darker days and unless there is a big change (which will realistically never happen) i don’t think i can continue to exist with my current state. i have tried too hard for too long and either nothing works or i’m put in impossible situations with insurmountable circumstances. in conclusion unless there is an outside source that changes my current state of affairs, i will shortly cease to exist. so in the words of a respectable hobbit, “this is the end. I am leaving now. goodbye.”",1
"Probably doesn't belong here, but...","I honestly just feel terrible when I come home from work, and it's been consistently awful this week in particular. I don't know if it's the long hours combined with other minor factors, but little things have been getting in my way constantly and it's not healthy. I keep feeling worthless and that I'm no good at anything and that I'd be better off not wasting everyone's money and time. That I'm going to lose everyone that I care about because of my mentality again. It's happened before. I've lost friends because of my inability to bear my feelings to the world. To visibly be suffering but be unable to say anything because it's not their burden to bear. I don't know why but my urge to end it all has been going up this week. I don't know why it's the case. The main reason I will not do that is because I already had one friend go that way this year - and I couldn't do that to my other friends that are left. It's hard enough on all of us to go at it minus one. I couldn't make it minus two. But this week has been such a tough week with me not being motivated to do anything of use and that I feel like I'm wasting everyone around me's time. The things I do end up exacerbating my situation - probably doesn't help the only stuff I do is play games like League and Smash Ultimate - games with super competitive ladders that actively punish negative performance. I just wish I could cure this with a snap of the fingers. This is awful. I hope this rant isn't too unwanted here too... I just needed somewhere to dump. I'd rather dump at some strangers than my friends, also, to be honest. They put up with my crap enough. I'm sure they're tired of it. I'm tired of it too. I wish I could see what others saw in me; because all I see is a worthless pile of trash that annoys everyone around him with plenty of other negative traits attached. What a raw deal.",1
eu decidi ir embora,"oi, isso era pra ser algo bem triste pra mim mas na verdade é algo libertador. eu finalmente criei a coragem de me m4t4r, eu sempre estive m0rto só que ninguém percebeu, agora todos irão saber. eu nunca sei quando esse sentimento começou, eu só sinto que desde o dia que eu acordei assim, uma parte de mim morreu, e com o tempo m0rri por inteiro. já tava na hora de eu ir, nada mais fazia sentido pra mim, eu não sabia o que ia ser do meu futuro, não tinha paixões, não tinha felicidade dentro de mim. não teve nada que eu faça que me fizesse preencher esse sentimento no meu coração. o vazio me fez ter nojo de mim mesmo, da minha própria voz, do amor, de viver. o tr4nstorno alimentar me fez querer arrancar e c0rtar cada pedaço feio e gordo do meu corpo. eu sinto nojo do meu próprio sorriso, eu me odeio muito, tentei terapia e o que pudesse melhorar e nunca adiantou.. infelizmente eu sempre nasci diferente, em todos os sentidos. nunca consegui me encaixar em nada, eu sempre tentei muito, muito mesmo, nada me deixava satisfeito. acho que meu destino era apenas uma participação na vida de todos pra no final eu mesmo me tirar do mundo. só queria soltar isso pra alguém.",1
Food,I ordered food even though I'm not hungry because I'm a fatass. I hate myself so much right now. I hope that the food clogs my arteries so much that I fucking die.,1
Comparison and disappointment,"I look around and see everyone else succeeding in their own ways, of course success and happiness is relative, I am well aware but comparing myself to other in my life I can seem to get myself to stop. Even with my friends, they are all such amazing people yet I compare myself. At first I believed it to be jealousy of their happiness and contentment and satisfaction they have with the directions they head in life. But now as I reflect it’s not jealously over them but rather anger and frustration with myself with not being able to get myself to even do the most basic of things. It’s not jealously as in I want to have what they have as we are all completely different people, yet I cannot stop feeling so angry at myself as I continually fail in ensuring that I can succeeded. I’m just so tired. And I’m mad at myself, why can’t I just get it together?",1
my depression is driving me insane,"i cant seem to maintain most relationships i’m in. i don’t mean to, i just get so depressed i don’t find any motivation. people ask me to hang out, i just end up sleeping through the time we were supposed to hang out. even with friends i’ve known a long time, i’m too insecure to even speak. i’m so anxious especially at night to be driving or walking so it’s hard to hang out with people late in the day. i’m just so sad most of the time. i don’t contribute to the conversation. i’m too scared to make someone mad w my opinion. most people don’t really think i’m smart enough to understand things. just bc i get so nervous explaining myself. so most of the time,the things i say go out one ear and out the other. sometimes i’m completely dismissed. i dont know what i’m doing anymore. i let everyone walk all over me, but once i’ve had it i let it out. then they’re upset that i’m pissed about something. i feel so trapped.",1
Suicide note to my girlfriend. Critique welcome.,"Dear [girlfriend],


I'm sorry for what I am about to do at the time I am writing this. I love you more than anything in the world, and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt you. I want you to know that none of this is your fault, that the thought of marrying you and starting a life together got me through some of my darkest moments. 


I am sorry that I was not strong enough to make it that far. 


I know that you will love again. When you do, I want you to find someone who treats you like the queen that you are. 


I want you to find someone better than me. Because you deserve better.


I wish you and your family the best.


Love,

This is literaly my only hopes of getting a ""brighter vision"", but i'm also afraid that if i'll do it i'll die and hurt many people around me. Everybody around me is talking what they drink, how it tasted, what drugs they took and i'm just sitting there like ""Okay...Once i took a deep breath from the smoke of a cigarette"". But instead i wanna say ""I took *two drugs* together with *Alcohol name*"". Its just fucked up..",1

I'm happy for them, always will be, but I can't help but feel jealous.

I truly don’t deserve to be happy and never will be ever again. Sadness and anger are truly all I will ever feel forever. No therapy and medications can ever help me, so I can’t change even if I wanted to.

I'm thinking about giving up,"“I am not good enough”, that is the thought that kept running through my head.


    The other day, I ran into my friend while on the way to the gym. We were able to talk and catch up about what’s been going on with our lives. He told me about how he got into this new relationship and been going out a lot. I’m happy for him, he deserves that life. It just got me thinking though, where the hell is my cool life? I know I know, I’m not entitled to any kind of reward, and the only thing I can really do is work on myself and hope that it comes through and works for me. Everything just starts to feel so hopeless though, I honestly feel like I haven’t progressed enough. Sure, I can talk to people better, but I should’ve been able to do that years ago. And now, it’s not like I’m even any good or anything. I’m going to the gym now, but my strength is nothing compared to where it was years ago. I used to be able to just go in and get my workout done, but nowI’m incapable of doing things that were so simple before. That’s not even mentioning my school performance, which was something I could always point to and say, “Hey look, at least I’m smart.” That’s gone now, and the performance simply says “Damn, I’m stupid.”  I’m ashamed to show myself to other people.


Sometimes I wonder, what’s the point of continuing? Was my past suicide note correct? Is there really nothing left for me here?


    With my own two eyes, I look out at the world. Everything seems tainted for some reason. This beautiful Earth filled with color and wonder is marked by gray. It’s as if there’s nothing that can give me enough hope to clear my head. Every interaction with others feels like a performance. I’m playing a part so that they don’t get pissed off, or sad, or feel like they need to attack me. A lot of times, it feels so draining, pretending.  I feel lost and scared. A rush of anxiety washes over me every morning, jolting me awake and making me fear something that isn’t even there yet. How can I hope to be fine? I am almost 20 years old and still lacking in so many different ways. I feel like the definition of mediocrity in a person, the way things have been going. I know, people will come up and tell me, “You’re still young, there’s time for you.”


    The only thought that runs through my brain now is, “How can you be so sure? How can you be so sure that things will turn out better?” The life I’ve always dreamed might always remain exactly that: a dream, a distant fantasy created by a far too naive and hopeful child. It may forever be just a piece of fiction wandered to by a lost and terrified boy hoping that there exists a Neverland for him to escape into. Growing up, I’ve come to see that this world is no storybook, and I am not a fictional character that will surely defeat his villains and reach that happy ending. I exist in a world full of unpredictability and chaos. A lot of times, that means I’m in this pit that I’m in now, looking up for any sign that says things will turn out okay.",1
i might end up as a deadbeat,"I failed my interview again yesterday. I graduated 2 years ago and i still don't have a proper job. All of my applications is either unanswered or i failed the interview. Tbh i just want to give up and just suck up to my parent and die when they are gone. I never thought i'd end up being the thing that i hate the most my whole life, a deadbeat, like my uncles who leech off of their siblings. What an irony my life is. I wonder if my uncle lives through the same thing as me when he was young.

Having anxiety sucks, i'm sure i'll be just fine and can do any job if i don't have it. Depression makes my whole life feels like shit. Why even my own mind hate itself. That's just weird af. And how come i'm so afraid of death when everyday i just want to kill myself.",1
It's getting worse,"I'm falling deeper and deeper into my mind. Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm loosing my friends. I feel like I annoy everyone around me. I just don't  want to be here anymore. If I disappear, no one will notice.  If I end it all tonight... things will get better for everyone else....",1
Feeling lost and undeserving of help,"TLDR: been feeling really down lately and don't know what to do

&#x200B;

It was very difficult for me to post this, but felt like I should and was told it would help, so hoping for some advice.

I am a 23 year old guy who lives with anxiety and mild autism (asperger's syndrome). I have low self esteem due to being bullied all throughout school for just being myself, my teachers and even my mother bullied me about my interests or my mannerisms. I had a few teachers who I swear picked on me on purpose. My father has always told me to bottle it up or to ""not worry about it and get over it"".

I am quick to blame myself for anything and everything that goes wrong and even when I do accomplish things, its expected and never appreciated. 

I feel like I am never good enough.

I currently live with my father and my younger brother, my father is not a bad father by any means. He allows me to live with him still and provides me with my computer and is paying for my current college courses which I'm grateful for, but he is emotionally distant.

I feel like my mental health does not matter because I am constantly reminded that others have it worse, so I am not allowed to have bad days. Won't even take me in to a doctor to get anything diagnosed or looked at because its a ""waste of money"" when I can just ""be happy"". I wish it were that simple.

I was told to pay for my own therapy if I really want it which isn't currently possible for me and I know he knows that, which feels awful.

My brother is a narcissistic drama queen who tries to make everything about himself, and has been my fathers top priority, even getting therapy over me. My brother has always been the priority and was my mothers favorite child, she's told me otherwise before but I knew she was lying to me.

On top of all this, my mother passed away about a year ago, I had my issues with her but the loss still hurt, and it hurt when my father told me if I'm still grieving or upset that there's ""something wrong with me"".

My anxiety often gives me difficulty falling asleep due to replaying painful past memories, and I have been having terrible nightmares just about every night, I sleep through the nights well enough but often wake up feeling disturbed or uneasy. Often still tired despite getting usually a full nights rest.

I have been starting everyday exhausted, with feelings of anxiety in my chest, and unmotivated for months now and I have no idea what to do. My hobbies are not as enjoyable as they once were. Sometimes I feel like its wrong to feel this way, that I should feel ashamed for it or that I don't deserve help since clearly my family does not want to help me.

I hate to admit it but I find myself believing that more often which is further worsening how I feel, I have intrusive thoughts telling me I am a failure or that I am not good enough, its been bad enough somedays where I feel like I need to cry but I can't. I am losing hope by the day that I will ever feel like myself again.

I have been venting to a few good friends for a while now and they suggested I look for further help, one told me about these subreddits that I did not know existed until now, so here I am.

I appreciate anyone just simply giving this a read.",1
"unorganized venting,","day by day it gets harder to find reasons why i should still go on. i've matured and become aware of the world i'm growing up in and i don't like it. its hard for me to find set purposes to get out of bed knowing all i do will just be washed away in time forgotten on this little space rock we call home in our universe. I have friends thankfully but i do fear the day we move on because they distract me from my head better then any food or media consumption could. all my indulging comforts are wearing out and i really don't want to resort to weed or alchohal. i actually don't know if i want to die really early in my adulthood or if i want to live a long life with half of it being pain and boredom. it makes me sad to see other people sad but the world is just too big for me to help everybody because we're all so different and the same at the same time. i'm just in my box trying to keep afloat in an ocean of other boxes doing the same. i've missed out on so much in my life but i have also gained so much in my time here. i feel like a failure, lost potential, not good enough, and that i'm a waste of everyones time. i'm nothing. i am just 1 of millenium.",1
I can't shake the feeling that the end is near.,"I never asked to be born, yet here I am. I've been fighting depression, anxiety, addiction and suicidal ideation for so long and I give the fuck up. I'm not willing to keep fighting, and I'm at the point where I don't know what the fuck I'm fighting for anymore. I've spent so much time, money and energy helping others at my own expense / detriment and I'm so fucking exhausted in every way imaginable. With any luck, I would die in my sleep.

I've been struggling so hard with my sobriety lately. I feel like if I could just have a drink or get high that maybe I could get numb and at least silence my brain for a little while. But I'm cognizant enough to know that it won't be enough and it'll just make me want more and more, and I'll be stuck on that damn hamster wheel again.

I'm sick of feeling lost, like I'm blindly stumbling my way through life with no sense of direction or purpose. I have no dreams, no goals, no aspirations. I can't remember the last time I was truly, genuinely happy because I've become so used to putting on an act and faking just to exist around other people without having to worry about them worrying about me.

I'm tired of faking like I'm ok. I'm not fucking ok and haven't been for a long time. Next Sunday is Father's Day and I haven't had a father for almost 2 years now. Thankfully, I don't have kids of my own, so at least I wouldn't have to deal with the guilt of fucking their lives up or them missing me. And yes, I know full well that if I go through with it that there are people in my life whose lives will never be the same. Maybe it would be best to take a long walk deep into the woods so that I wouldn't be found for several days. Perhaps by then some carnivore will have eaten me so that it would look like an accident.",1
im depressed and cant tell anyone how i really feel.,"im depressed and i feel like i can't tell anyone. i just graduated high school & i feel like i'll never have a future. ive been extremely sick my entire senior year. i ended up switching to online the second day in. i haven't seen any of my friends in months and barely leave my room. im constantly in pain and feeling i'll. i've struggled with mental illness and substance abuse since i was 14. i just feel like as soon as i overcome one thing i'm constantly thrown another. im in extreme pain everyday and i feel as if everyone invalidates it. i have all these hopes and goals. i want to live my life, travel, find love. yet all i've done the past year is lay in bed and watch tv. i have no energy to get up or leave my house. ive been to countless doctors the past year with no answers. im up till 3 am almost every night in pain just wishing i could disappear, that the pain would stop. i don't want to live anymore because i feel as if i'm not really living like this. im expected to go to college starting in the fall and i can't even fathom the idea. no one really understands how i feel and they all think i'm over exaggerating. ive had health anxiety my whole life & have panic attacks constantly wondering if i have cancer or some chronic illness. i want an answer but at the same time i don't. if this is something i have to deal with the rest of my life i just don't see how i can continue living. nothing makes me happy anymore. ive just been needing to get this off my chest but i can't complain to anyone else. thank you.",1
I don't want my death to be an inconvenience,"I know that my family would want to have a funeral for me. I know family members would come visit with one another to check up. I know that some people would mourn. But I don't want that. I don't want people to give a shit about my death. I don't know if I'm selfish for wanting to die or selfish for not wanting others to care or if they're selfish for making me stay alive.

There is no possible time that I could kill myself that would not be an inconvenience. There's always a birthday or a holiday or some occasion that it just wouldn't work out. I just wish I was alone. I wish no one gave a shit so I could do it without feeling guilty. I wish everyone would leave me be so I could get drunk and then kill myself. I hate everything.",1
The Cyclical Nature of Depression,"Has anyone else noticed their depression seems to come around in waves? I suffered from it intensely as a preteen, teenager, and young adult (I cut myself and was close to attempting suicide multiple times), but thought that removing myself from my traumatizing environment would alleviate the issue. It seemed to... for a while. Now I'm in early middle age and realize that it's not gone, just simmering below the surface. Sometimes it springs up again and it humbles me, in an awful, potent way. Rumination about ending things... the futility of life... realizing existence is painful and pointless... etc. I just wonder how long I can continue to hope it will go away again before I get tired or before it wins. What is the point of trying to work through it when it will always come back? How long can beauty and joy really overcome the depths of despair? Does anyone else grapple with these thoughts?",1
One of the reasons,"I think I found one of the reasons why I might be depressed.

Its because I am smart enough to see how fucked the world and everyone around me is, but I am not smart enough to do anything about it, but I am smart enough to notice that again, that nothing I do matters that everyone is still fucked, I mean there a lot of things wrong in me too but I think that might be one of the reasons I feel like shit all of the time. And the worst part is I still havent lost hope that maybe everything will magically be better again, well I have lost hope but sometimes I havent. Nothing of this makes any sense and I dont want any responses I just wanted to write this all down and vent a bit.",1

i don’t have a psychiatrist but i’m planning on just booking an online visit. how do i tell the psychiatrist that i am on the verge of ending myself without saying that so i don’t get sent to the ward obviously. i can write a book about all that is going on in my life and i really feel like spiraling.",1

I'm loosing my brother.,"My world is shattered into peices. 

My brother's condition is critical.

This happened as a result from a self inflicted gunshot to the head. He shot himself in the forehead, almost dead center. The bullet caused multiple skull fractures, severe brain damage in almost all critical areas of the brain. 

He was dead at the scene and revived by paramedics and rushed to the hospital Friday morning of June 10th, 2022. He is on a ventilator for breathing, and adrenaline to keep his heart going. Evey function of his body is being facilitated by medical machines or medicine. 

Today, Saturday, June 11th two members of the neuro surgeon team informed me and my mother that the swelling in his head has started to affect his vital stats; and even if the swelling disapates; the best we could hope for is a persistent vegetative state. 

My brother effectively died at the scene the morning of June 10th. My mother and I keeping his body alive long enough for some extended family to get here and say their good byes. 

Funeral arrangements and services will be announced when my mother and I have handled the logistics.

Missed out on the experiences of my adolescence,"I'm nearly 27, enby (closeted), and currently stuck living at home with my parents after washing out of my PhD. I'm aware that the 'young' stage of my life is coming to a close and I feel like I've missed out on the 'young people stuff' that I always wanted to do.

Stuff like... going out into the middle of nowhere with a bunch of friends for a few weeks, getting drunk, having a good time, idk dumb shit like skinny dipping, making out with strangers or whatever. I feel like my friends have always been from the right demographics who should be into this sort of thing - young, leftie, queer 20-somethings - but they've always turned out to be straight-laced, uninterested in that kind of adventure, would rather sit at home knitting, in some cases even prudish.

Work has partly got in the way - I've been in academia my whole adult life, never taken a gap year or anything. And now I'm living in suburbia (London, UK, if it matters), with no friends locally and few enough long distance who will return my messages on a timescale of less than like 3-6 months. And I feel like now I've lost the pre-built communities that uni made for me, and have nothing to fill that void, and all without doing any of the rebellious adventuring that you're supposed to do in your 20s.

No idea how to meet people, and even if I did no idea how to make sure they're the kind of people who want to do these things I've missed out on up til now

It's just... idk, saddening, I guess. I'm nowhere near where I want to be with my transition, love life, or career, but I thought by now I'd at least have all these kinds of *experiences* under my belt.",1
16 (m) Constant reminder of being not loved,I’m fine with talking with girls and asking them out but I can really read a lack of interest there showing making my efforts seem wasted and my confidence shot to shit I work out every day and put on a façade of everything is ok and my life is interesting because if I don’t my value will be substantially lowered to other men I don’t understand the lack of affection for me after tens of different girls I’ve attempted with I’m represented as a lower being than them and I am worth nothing.,1
Sticking around,"I'm going to stick around for a while. For my girlfriend. Because no matter how bad I feel, no matter how much I feel that life isn't worth it, I know that she is worth it.

I just lost all hope,Not only people in real life don't care about me but also making a post gets zero interest. I never felt so useless. Also I'm trying to write this post again because last one got auto removed by a bot by being too short. Even a bot doesn't care about me it just sucks:(,1

i'm feeling quite down lately.,"Hi, this is the first time I wrote something. I've been dealing w depression & anxiety for so long, even tho i'm only 20 years old. This week I had some trouble trying to get my meds so i've been off antidepressants & clearly my brain can't let me be happy. Yesterday saw a boy, we had a great time but now I feel worse. And of course  i've been fantasizing  some shitty ideas, I can't give up now, I was doing fine and honestly I can't keep getting depressed almost every day.

[M20] So tired of this,"I just can't make any friends irl, I'm alone for more tham 3 years now. I basically moved twice and went 2 years in a new school. Everyone already had friends there and it was just impossible to be in the class because it sucked. I have tried so hard. When I start make some friends they just leave me and never message me unless I do first, they just don't care and aren't interested in my at all. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna do anything because I'm sick of doing things alone. I alao have no idea what I wanna do with life. And I don't think I will ever make any friends because school was my only option. I don't know if I even be willing to reply to anyone here I just don't have any motivation, I need to talk to someone irl and express my feelings because I haven't done that for years, I would really want to hug my best friend if I had one:(.

Depressed and medication ain’t working.,Idk I have depression and I’m on some medication for it and idk what happened but today I feel like I hit a deep low. I’ve just been laying on my gaming chair looking at the same spot for almost a whole hour listening to the same song and as I’m laying here I was just thinking of all the things that happened these last 6 months. I remember back in February I would think how I would feel in June and we’ll it’s June and nothing got better. Now as I look back I just want to disappear. Like really just disappear. To just get up and go anywhere and try start fresh. Does anyone feel like that too?,1
Free Churro,"I’m rewatching the Free Churro episode of Bojack Horseman. 

God this just some of the best television / monologue ever made. 

In that sweet spot of depression where one longs for better but isn’t so destroyed that they just can’t, I like to rewatch Free Churo. 

Knowing that someone else wrote that, and that Will Arnett could say it all so perfectly, just helps me feel warm inside. Helps me feel not alone. 

I love knowing that so many people have felt something like this that a whole tv show was made to explore every detail of it. 

It’s the perfect length but I also want it to be three times as long.",1
Having a hard time with a new chapter in life,"I'm mostly doing this just to vent, and to clarify, I was depressed for a whole year between March 2018 and March 2019, but as of today I'd say I'm happy, but with these situations I might end up facing, I will probably fall into it for a second time.

I'm 17, with a small family consisting of a loving 57 year old mother who is physically weak and I try to help, an alcoholic father who lives with us but we mostly ignore who we can't get rid of because he is paying for the house, and my grandmother who lives in a different
neighbourhood 15 minutes from us. We are poor, and my mother made the point that she makes just enough money to keep living, and she can't spend too much on our personal lives. I am actively
looking for work. We will probably end up having to move to our grandmothers house, which isn't that terrible, but I think the emotional and sentimental toll will be heavy, at least for me, since we have lived in our home for 16 years.

I must mention that my mother has undiagnosed depression, and with our current situation i’ve felt it stronger than before, and unfortunately whenever my mom feels sad I feel sad too.

My grandmother recently lost vision in her left eye and can only see blur, her right eye is doing better but it can spread to the other eye anytime and her vision has been significantly damaged. She will hopefully have an operation soon.

Another thing that that is not my mind constantly is the fact that my mother and grandmother will have a hard time getting along, since they both have completely different mindsets and ideologies and both are stubborn, I fear that they will constantly fight, although that might eventually get better.

And here I am, in the middle of all of this, trying to appear to stay positive for both of them so they don't lose hope, but in reality I have no idea what to do. I'm in
a boarding school most of the week but I feel so guilty recently that I'm not present back at home. I might try to talk to a friend but it's hard for me to open
up about such a big and wide subject…

Anybody who went through a similar situation and managed to pull through could lend me some advice? Thanks in advance, Shalom.",1
lost,"Idk if this help me but I feel like I should reach out to the unknown. I'm the only child to my mom, grew up with little to no friends. I go to work and just go home and just sit at home alone no one to talk too and no idea how to reach out and actually have friends. I have a girlfriend and she told me I'm not meeting her love language and it pretty easy to do but in the last couple months I just been down and out quiet lost and confused. Idk what I'm looking for and even if I will get a response with this post but I'm wondering am I just going down a hole of depression I'm a pretty positive person but I'm more to be there for everyone else but me I never can get that same feeling and friendships. If anyone has advice or just someone to talk to please respond thank you.",1
Dating is seriously alien to me...,"**I don't really get how relationships start.**

I haven't had the most positive relationship, no pun intended, with those feelings.

I had a little crush on someone when I was ten, and the whole class followed me down the hallway making fun of me, chanting her name.

>Ella, Ella....

**I was never the ""type of person"" to have a relationship.**

Even in adulthood. People would be talking about how they met their partners, and they wouldn't bother asking me. They know I've probably never been in a relationship. 

When I add something to the conversation, they change the subject. I guess I don't know what I'm talking about.

**It just feels so far-fetched. It feels stupid to even think about it.**

I haven't been on a date before.

Yes. I haven't gone out with anyone for one night. 

Can you really imagine someone wanting to be with me for three months, which by the way, is barely the starting point of a relationship?

I want to... but I guess that's just not my place in life. My place in life is to be the person people think about, but not deeply.

**I'm meant to be the person people will miss when I die, but not when I'm alive.**",1
Holy fuck my nerves have been shot lately.,"I’ve been dealing with depression for almost a year now and never got diagnosed with anxiety, was told at the time that I didn’t have any symptoms.

I had my first panic attack in years too, was just out and about then got super overwhelmed and I have no idea why, but I had to go home cuz of it.

overwhelmed with depression lately,"Its been popping up more and more into my head lately and it seems like things keep getting worse.

i think i might be depressed..,"I (24F) think i may be depressed. I feel like my life is slowly falling into sh*t.

Second, it doesn’t feel the same with my bf of almost 2 years.. he made some online friends and since then he plays on xbox live w them and it’s like all he cares about doing on his free time, like he rather be playing with them then spend time with me, we haven’t gone on any dates since valentine’s day, also im not materialistic at all but he doesn’t do little things for me like i would for him, im not asking for him to spend $100 or even $50 whatever on a date id be happy with a blanket and sandwich’s whatever at a park having a picnic date but he just doesn’t seem to be interested and so it makes me feel not special to him even if he says otherwise and that he loves me so much, we went from seeing each other everyday him begging to see me to maybe seeing each other 2-3 times a week and if it’s if i call him not if it were up to him i think he’d be home playing his games, Lastly, things at home are falling apart too, my mom just complains about everything she recently went thru a breakup i understand she may be heartbroken but it’s like she somehow blames me. she talks about moving far away and not looking back it kinda hurts.

Confusing depressing relationship,"I don't wanna bore u guys but I'm really confused with my relationship, long term relationship some of it was long distance. After two years apart due to covid n some health problems on my end we finally saw each other which was amazing. Unfortunately right away I noticed comments about my appearance from her  which she claim it was deep but I heard the same stuff for the first two weeks. I wasnt liked before weighing over 200 pounds mostly muscle I became under 160 with no muscle  due to the medical issue I had. Both of used to talk bout things to do and plenty of sexual stuff since we both craving each other and we used to having sex 4-6 times a week   but during my stay with her we barely had sex and there were always excuses which is when I felt really shitty about my self. Self esteem was so low, I hav my medical condition which is killing me inside and my partner making me feel like I'm not enough. Btw before our long break of LDR I wasn't the best partner and she was always trying her best and I feel like I wanted to change and she was up for it and it seemed like that was a thing of the past. Now that we see each other I became so different in a good way, I was there emotionally and was cold like before, I wouldn't be mad at simple stuff, I'd let go of things for the better of us two, I honestly did a 360 for the better and she changed but unfortunately not for the best. I understand if she has resentment for the years before and I expected her to leave me I honestly wouldn't hav been mad. Going back to wat had recently, when I got really ill she during the stay she didn't care much she thought of it was a exaggeration and wasn't helpful if I needed her help. Before I came to visit she was always out with her friends and I was really happy for her but when I arrived everything stopped like I ruined her fun. It hurts to see first hand how when I was an asshole our relationship seemed better but now that I opened up and don't have the same appearance it feels like she can't wait till I leave.",1
Does anyone else feel the need to distance themselves from people they love and care for just because they feel worthless?,I feel like people don’t deserve me in their lives weighing them down so I usually push them away or distance myself.

I miss my ex so much and it’s been 3 years since we were together and she’s now married… I have no friends that genuinely care about me anymore and I just feel like I have no purpose or anything left worth living for now and it’s all my fault  :(,1
Can’t stop feeling suicidal,"I have a long history of depression and anxiety and it just doesn’t seem to get better. Last year my ex tried to ruin my career/life after we broke up after he gaslit me for years and I stuck around because he had me believe he was the best I could get and I think I have PTSD, or at the very least pretty bad anxiety exacerbation, from it. I have a great new job and boyfriend and externally my life seems to be doing much better. I go to therapy I take antidepressants (out of other ones to try though so this is the best it’ll get) I do all the things I’m supposed to but I can’t help but being haunted by this incident and worrying that it’ll somehow come back to me or something else bad will happen and I’ll end up all alone and won’t be able to work.

I'm thinking of taking my own life and sparing my parents of unnecessary expenses.,"Sorry for the long text it's probably just my frustration. 
Hello everybody, a little introduction :  I'm a 23 year old Indian female currently living with my parents in their house. I am a medical student of an University in China and have been stuck in my own country since January 2020 when I'd come back for my winter break. It has been almost 2.5 years now and there is no news or updates of going back to complete my education and get my degree. The Indian government has issued a notice regarding the students who have been studying online for more than 2 years stating their degree will be invalid due to no practical exposure. So that will not let me appear for my foreign medical graduate exam in my own country to obtain a practising licence either. 

I feel stuck. I've given three years on campus and two years online to this degree and even then I won't be able to become a doctor or have a practicing license. 
China has been extremely cruel to us. The fact that they're least bothered about their students has fucked a lot of us. 
We feel socially isolated because of the reason that we do not have an answer to the question people ask us about our future. The uncertainty has become a dark cloud over our lives. A lot of us don't feel motivated enough to study anymore. The anticipation has been around for too long now. It has given us anxiety and panic attacks. I get mental and emotional breakdowns almost every now and then. I am going into severe depression and I can't help myself. 
My parents have been extremely worried about me too. But they're also worried about the money they've invested in my degree and future which is not giving us any fruitful results. This has frustrated them a lot and slowly it's been coming onto me. We have frequent fights over it and they keep taunting how they should've never spent so much money on me because it's not that I'm studying in my house either. 

I've tried to study, I was till a few months ago but then it just suddenly stopped. I don't feel motivated enough to start studying again. I feel depressed all the time. Like I've nothing to live for now. Before I used to feel sad about myself but now I've become numb. It's worse actually because my parents don't understand me at all so that doesn't help either. Mentally and emotionally I've become weak and unable to control myself, especially with my breakdowns. I am a person who has always been against self harm and taking your own life but recently I've only been thinking about that. Sparing my parents of this unnecessary burden of expenses they'll have to endure for me. And sparing myself of this heavy uncertainty in life. 



Tldr: not being able to complete my graduation which is making me depressed and my parents frustrated leading me to think about committing suicide.",1
I self sabotage with unsafe sex,Im 29 and just this past year I've been unsafe and I really regret it. Now I'm scared I've given myself an sti and can't afford to be tested till next week. I hope it's negative. A big wake up call for sure. How else do you self sabotage when severely depressed?,1
What is the point,"The point of life is to work until you die, and the only thing to stop the work is momentary fleets of happiness to distract us from the fact that we are here for no reason. Sure, you can make others happy, sure they will be sad if you go. But it all ends. We are finite. If I go now, the people in my life will eventually get over it, they may have their lives put on hold for a while, but I mean nothing in the grand schemes of my loved one’s lives. Why am I here? What do I contribute to society that someone else couldn’t do? I’m a fraudulent excuse for a being with a purpose.",1

I know I am not alone with this situation and I understand it’s not only me who has been having trouble with confidence talking to people and even making friends but no matter how hard I try to find some sort of courage to speak to people I crumble immediately and distance myself from whatever I do. 

I have been experiencing dramatic problems with my emotions mainly late at night where I would break out crying and not sleeping for nights at a time because I feel that my dreams are plaguing my mind with false happiness and hope. 

I have been wondering if there is any point in keep going or if I should just keep bottling this stuff up to myself because I only see two ways forward and that is me doing something drastic or keeping everything quiet.",1

So that you can survive to work harder at a job that takes up most if not all of your energy so that you can soend what little time and energy you have to sometimes get your basic needs met just to do more work at a job you can somewhat tolerate. Where is the time and energy for the things you ACTUALLY want to do, assuming you have other aspirations because you worked so hard you don't even know what to do with yourself when you get a nugget of idle downtime?

I feel like I’m on the zenith of stupidity.My iq level is decreasing with each day.My memory is declining day by day and with each passing day I feel like I can’t express myself clearly.In majority of the situations ,I don’t have any words to express myself,I just stay in the middle of friends,family or gathering just listening to what they have to say.in Most of the cases I don’t have any opinion at all. I feel immensely stupid at those times.I just feel poor of myself.The irony is that my situation is so worse ,but I just can’t explain that well as stupid person like me just  don’t have words ,I  just don’t know how to articulate my  thought process,i am  basically a pathetic looser.
Apart from these , I find it really hard to maintain continuity in my speech ,I keep forgetting what I have to say.Most of the time ,I just don’t know what I am speaking.Just some random words come out of my mouth during conversations .


This is not it,I also have speech impediment.From recent 2 to 3 years ,I am finding it really hard to speak certain English words.Especially the ones ,ending with s/es and many difficult English words like entrepreneur.I find myself constantly fumbling during speeches.

Also I have memory issues , I forget things easily.I can’t even remember the details easily.I find it really hard these days to learn new topics in my academics.


My dream is to be civil servant , which one can become only by cracking the toughest exam here in my country But ,Because of all these issues  I am having ,i feel like I would never be able to achieve my dream ever in my life .



These problems are giving me really hard time in living my day to day life.

Just wrote an exam i had a backlog for... I have wrote well but due to my anxiety and depression and brain fog i lackin clarity nd forget things soon so i dont know i mightve messed it up. if i fail to clear the backlog i might be in a situation where i might have to repeat an year in college while my peers enter the final year and sit for job placements and the thought of that is wrapping me up in shame. Ive seen many psychologists and doctor but no body has ever cared to tend to my issues. Im stuck because of lack of proper mental and health support by my doctors. I hate bearing grudges or wishing bad things on others but the way these doctors have ignored my issues, its messed me even more. Im not able to live any longer. My future is getting worse... Nd my health issues are making it so much harder to bounce back. I sit everyday in class with a lump in my throat and a burning sensation, mental dissociation, anxiety nd try to manage my academics to the best of ny capabilites but nothing seems to be getting better anymore. Even peers are scums lowkey so I don't got much support from others.I don't wanna commit suicide. I wanna live and embrace life.

Its like Im stuck in a nightmare where everything is vivid yet I don't have any Im powerless, and If I do something, things get worse. Im not allowed to fail cuz if I do I get blamed and reminded of it constantly.

I keep switching from ""Im just getting what I deserve"" to ""why the hell is all this happening to me"" over and over again. At this point everything in my memory of the last 6 years is a fucking mess.

Im just tired man, Im really tired. To know I have to choose and stick to this way of life for the rest of the time Im breathing is an interesting feeling. But regardless I can't let up ig. Being human with emotions is a burden. These shits wear me down so much. Feels like Im losing touch and just sinking. Fuck me",1

I’m also a carer for my disabled mother who I’m currently trying to get moved out of her hoarded shithole and crappy village to somewhere she can have some independence and social interaction outside of the small minded idiots that we currently call neighbours. It’s been almost a year since I got my stepdad removed from the home for being abusive towards her (the neighbours seem to think I did it out of spite) and whilst I hate being stuck abroad, I’m dreading going home. 

I know when a bad depression spell is starting to hit because I start sleeping during the day.

I probably know how to break this vicious cycle....but I'm too tired to break it.," Warning: wall of text incoming. And I'd really appreciate if there's any psychologist lurking in this sub who may be interested in helping me.

Insomia is destroying me, day after day, year after year. Whatever personal improvement I want to make to quit my current status as a low wage worker to pursue my passions and become a healthier, better person gets constantly thwarted by my lack of energy and focus....which is caused by my effing insomnia. And its a weird kind: It almost always catches me whenever I sleep out after 01:00 AM for whatever reason I know the warning signs, and once I start feeling them its already too late:

1-My pillow feels unreasonably hard or too soft for my neck. I need to turn it around constantly so my head doesn't seem to be too high nor sinking into the pillow.

2- A strange warmth starts to take over my body. Even in winters, I may start feeling as it its so hot I can't sleep with any blanket over me. It's even worse in hot climates.

3-When I'm really sleepy, my eyelids feel heavy and tight, but when these symptoms take over, they feel light and hyper sensitive to the smallest signs of luminiscence that may be around, even if its just moonlight through my darn window.

4-My mind starts recalling whatever heavy song I listened to during that day and start replaying it all over the place, hence why I started listening to very chill music in the hours previous to sleeping to counter it...but sometimes its not enough.

When these symptoms arrive, they stay until 3:00 or 5:00 am, up to 8:00 am on the very worst days. I'm there, laying on my bed, tired as hell but feeling as if my head was overflowing with air. In the worst occasions, sleep apnea will hit.

On the next morning, I would end up as an irascible, sore zombie who can barely function socially and can't do much besides working, binge eating, somehow working out and do chores. I've been close to killing myself several times (both intentionally and accidentally) over the years due to my constant failures. My health is getting worse and I feel I'm going nowhere with my life. Very few friends, no romance at all, a family that dislikes me more and more and nobody who can understand my issues are what makes up my social circle.

I'm losing my passion for every hobby I once loved. Even when I want to be an artist who lives from his craft, I cannot hone my skills or even consume the art that is supposed to inspire me because I consider it as spending precious time I need to figure out a way to make extra income and quit my current job...which leads me to have a messy schedule that leaves me always feeling there's something pending I need to finish before the ''non essentials''...which by the end of the day, leaves me tired, empty and procastinating, wasting time as the hours pass until its past 1:00 am again...and the vicious cycle repeats.

My only solace I find in weekends, when I get to sleep at outrageous hours knowing I won't have to work on the next day while enjoying some leisure...but that seems to destabilize my sleeping schedule for the rest of the following week.

All in all, maybe I already know all the tips and solution to this problem...but I'm too effing tired to break this vicious cycle before it definitely breaks me.

If anyone may know how or who can help me, I'll deeply appreciate it.",1
The government doesn’t care about mental health,I have a huge amount of absences from school cause I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and can’t function or do anything. I had a court meeting about my absences and the judge said people with mental illnesses use this as a crutch to get their way and be lazy. They said if I don’t finish summer school work I’ll be sent away from my house. I don’t want to be sent away and I psychically can’t do anything. I just want my life to be over.,1
What to do with myself,"So real quick cuz I do not want to take up too much time and I also feel like someone has said this already. I want to kill myself. I am making little money with a large amount of debt no hobbies that I am good at, little motivation and I am in my mid 30s. How can I move forward and look past my failures? As funny this may sound I googled for the answer and to my dismay the answers are easier said than done. Any thoughts or anyone experiencing this? Thank you for your time",1
What's keeping me here,One of the few things keeping me alive right now is my laziness. I don't feel like getting out of bed just to look for a rope to put me out of my misery.,1
Male PPD,"So I recently had my first baby and thought it was going to be hard but overall happy. I was working a terrible job, and hated it, but it was paying the bills. About 2 weeks after my baby was born I got covid, and about 3 weeks after that my dog had to be put down. I've already been diagnosed with depression, then all this stuff compounded on top of it. Last night I learned that about 25% of fathers experience post-partum depression. For me, it's been a terrible cycle. I feel like I'm failing as a dad because the nights when my fiance is at work I can't calm him down on my own, then I get frustrated and angry because I can't fix it, then I think how things would be better if he wasn't here, then to how if I was gone I wouldn't have to worry about anything, then I feel like a bad father again because I think suicide is the way out of a hole dug around my kid. And thus the cycle starts all over. I have no idea what to do anymore",1
"As years go by, there's less and less to live for","I don't even recognize myself anymore these days. There's nothing to live for now. No more dreams, no more aspirations, no more hope. I think I'm just waiting to die now",1
Don't know if I regret choosing to live or not,"I don't know if I regret choosing to go to the hospital or not. I guess time will tell. I still want to die right now, but the only thing stopping me is my girlfriend. I love her so much, and I know she loves me (although I don't know why).",1
Serious Doubt,"Hi, if hypothetically somebody decided it's time to leave.

In advance thank you very much.",1
am I depressed or am I lazy?,"Ever since I was young I was told constantly by both family and teachers that I was lazy. Never went out to play with the other kids they would bully me (hurt me physically and verbally) anyways. I feel invisible I mean I feel like people intentionally ignore me 
Till this day as an adult going to the grocery store takes me a lot of mental preparation and sometimes I will go out and quickly come in without reaching the store and back to my bed. My room is a mess and can't bring my lazy ass to clean. I'm between I have given up but not really vibe. I think I can do better, i know it but I just can't bring myself to do it
Tried therapy but stop the moment I felt attacked in someway",1
I regret not killing myself,I had it planned. For almost a week. I was going to go to the top floor of the hospital after my therapy appointment today and jump. Yesterday I changed my mind when my dad gave me money to pick up my prescription. Its not about the money it was about him offering support to me. Now I'm home and I just can't handle this anymore. I wish I could go back to the hospital and do it. I wish there was a closer building that was that tall. I wish I could go back and do it. I want to go back there and do it,1
My eating disorder,"TW for EDs I guess, no details just general stuff - I’ve struggled with eating disorders for years. Went from both extremes and now slightly overweight with under a year ago being dangerously underweight. I know EDs don’t always lead to depression but having both is killing me. I’m so self conscious all the time and feel my body and once I’d promise myself to kill myself if I was ever to let myself get to this point. I now exceeded that weight which I understand some would consider still healthy, but now I am just so depressed I don’t care anymore. At least I don’t think I do. I miss my old body though I know I was at a stage my my life was on the line. I can’t keep going with the back and forth of this ED. My mental health is spiralling and I’m just tired. I should be focusing on my exams rn but all I can think about is the fact I don’t want to live in my body anymore. Sometimes I’d rather be dead than to have to deal with this.",1
My current life situation.,"This is a throwaway account that I made, it's my first time posting on Reddit so I don't know what to say but il try.

I'm a teenager and life just keeps rolling down an endless hill. I always try to think that it will get better but it never does. it always just gets worse than it was before and I don't really want to try anymore. i really don't feel like trying anymore. I can't even keep up with school anymore. my grades keep getting worse and I started losing the people around me, it feels like I'm fighting a hopeless battle that I am probably gonna lose. I don't know what others do at my age to remain so calm and stress-free but I feel like I'm always stressed and not really feeling good. when I see others my age succeed at other things it makes me feel miserable. I don't have any special talents and I'm not really good at anything .now I'm heading into my last weeks of school and I have a lot of exams and tests and I don't feel like trying. like what's the point of trying if I know I'm gonna fail? the more I think about it the more I just don't wanna leave my room and just stay inside. this month I also lost a lot of childhood friends that I had known since I was in first grade and that made it even worse. they think I'm weird or don't like my company. I don't really wanna talk to anyone about this cause I don't know anyone I can trust to talk about this. I still talk to a lot of family and a  few other people but I just tell them life is going good and I'm going to go far in life but to be honest I don't really know what I'm gonna do. I had hoped to reach high in life when I was a little younger but now I just think that I'm going to end up nowhere in life and probably not have any kids or family . I really don't like how my life is going right now and I don't see any way to fix it. by each day it's getting even worse and school is stressing me out even more. i keep losing friends left and right and no one really wants to talk to me.",1
I'm depressed because I can't be a professional athlete,"I am 25 years old male, I have 3/4 years muay thai experience in past years. My perspective on life has changed a lot lately. Although I loved sports in the past years, we moved to a small town due to financial reasons (I could not pay the dues for the gym) and my family's job. I couldn't find a gym in the city where I went to study at university. In the future, I will not be able to continue this sport due to the profession I have chosen. I can't continue right now. As time passed, my obsession with sports started to increase. Even when I'm on the road, I put on headphones and turn on the music, I imagine myself as a fighter, I always imagine myself fighting. I feel very sad when I see national athletes on television or on the internet. right now i need to study to complete my university but i can't concentrate. I think about muay thai all day long. moreover, I don't have the courage to leave the house, go to another city, find a salon and work. Private sector working conditions in Turkey are very heavy. Even if I can find a job, it is not clear that I will be able to continue sports and if I do not secure my future, living conditions in Turkey are very difficult. I'm so bored",1
i messed up,"i found this perfect girl and i messed up.

we were talking online. and then i asked if we could meet. she suddenly seemed distant and dont reply as much. i got worried and asked if she's angry or what. she then really got angry and said she was just busy etc plus other hurtful words

i tried to pacify it by saying ill admit my mistake. she then said im playing the victim card. i was just trying to end the argument. then she said hurtful things like it is because of my awfulness thats why bad things had happened to me previously.

those bad things were things i shared with her in confidence. she twisted it to hurt me instead. i then have had enough and answered back. then i was blocked.

trying to take the blame made me look weak and was told i was playing the victim card. if take the blame so the argument will be finished, i am playing victim card, if i answer back then im a jerk. what else could i have done.

i am really down right now. i dont know what i did wrong and i feel like i hurt her and i want to make it better but im blocked and theres no chance we'll talk again anymore.

im such a loser.",1
How do you forget someone?,"I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried blocking her. I’ve tried keeping busy all the time. I’ve tried keeping something playing 24/7 so I don’t have a chance to think. Hell, I’ve even tried Pavloving myself every time I consciously think about her. Yet every single time I wake up, the first thing that comes to mind is her name as if it’s the only thing that’s pushing me to get up in the first place. I’ve had attachment issues before but this feels different and out of hand. I want it to stop so bad",1
what am I supposed to do.,I've been struggling for more than 5 months now. I can't bring myself to study I can't bring myself to do anything. I tried a lot. I tried making a to do list it didn't work. I open the book and I get ready to study but then I don't.  I don't know what's wrong with me maybe it's just laziness but it feels more than that. I dropped the year because I kept failing the tests. Now I'm terrified of going back to school. I just wanna be the old me again. Study and get As on my tests,1
"Im legit tired of it all, I’m so done","I want a human connection but I genuinely don’t have any feelings towards much people , romantic or platonic. I want to socialize and get out the house but my anxiety is torturing me and making me scared to get up and do anything. I want to be able to be vulnerable and have “my person” but honestly I don’t know if I will be able to. I get all these thoughts about will they accept me for my autism, the fact Im gay, will they support me in being a woc, all these labels, all these rules, society smh fuck it all",1
I feel trapped,"I've been suffering with some some sort of mental illness for my whole life now, the only thing that I remember from middle school is me wondering how much it would've hurt if I jumped from the window in our classroom. I've probably experienced some sort of trauma but I hardly remember anything about my life before like 4 years ago.
I've been hospitalized and I'm on meds. I've been on a lot of different meds and since I'm underage doctors have finished every option that they can legally prescribe to an underage person.
Nothing has worked. I feel like a lab rat, every few months if not every month they change my meds bc they don't work or they quickly worsen my condition. 3 different psychiatrists have been raking care of me at the same time but they still don't know what I have because i have too many symptom and their intensity varies ao often there aren't enough serious symptoms to make me fall into a category. I probably have bpd or bipolar, but those are just some wild guesses. Also, I'm trans non-binary and doctors don't believe mw, they keep saying that it's just a phase and that it's probably my mental illness' fault and ok, even if it's true, why can't you respect my name and pronouns if it makes me feel better? Also, my parents are really homo-trasphobic so there's that too.
I've recently started taking lithium, they said it would help with my mood swings. It's been a month and nothing has changed, indeed, it's goind downhill. I've struggled with self harm and I've been clean for a long time, but now thoughts about self harm and suicide are starting to come back stronger than ever and I'm scared of myself bc i don't wanna do it. Also, in the part I've struggled with eating disorders and thoughts about it are coming back too. Every evening i go with my mum into her bed and I cry like a baby. Luckily lately she have been coming to terms with my mental health issues and now kinda understand that I will hardly ever totally beat it. Doctors even used the word ""terminal"" to describe my illness, saying that I will probably have it till the day I die.
It's been years, i keep fighting and struggling, I can't get better and people around me keep pushing me to keep trying, not understanding that I can't do it anymore. I'm tired and even if ilI sleep it doesn't go away.
I'm really debating whether I should give up now, I feel like I'm in one of those movies where people are sticking to a rock with their fingertips and they slowly start falling down. It hurts to keep rrying and I'm really hopeless right now.
Sorry, just wanted to get it off my chest + English isn't my first language so bare with me",1

Im so overwhelmed, and I’m not telling you everything.",1
Stay or go,"Ive been planning for a month or so now to kill myself in july. i think my partner is about to break up with me and they are the only reason i was willing to make it so far. i wanted to make it to their birthday and tell them i loved them one last time. im holding onto a sliver of hope that they choose to stay with me but they seem so happy without me. in this time im writing my suicide note(in the form of a lengthy poem and essays about my delusions). i keep seeing my other friends talk about how they were abused and raped and it shows me that me feeling so depressed is unearned. it runs in my maternal family but they all deal with severe trauma and ive been left with the effects without a cause. i want to blame it on something but the only person to turn the knife unto is myself. nothing really makes me happy except my partner and i knew i shouldnt have gotten attached because they deserve better and i knew i wasnt going to make it past 2023. being alive hurts more and more everyday and each day i have such intense suicidal thoughts that were once stopped by my eagerness to be there for my partner, but without them right now its hard to keep going. i know they're gonna be hurt either way, so I've been thinking about leaving my state so they'll never find out if im dead or just missing. whenever i wake up i miss the pills i used to abuse and not a day goes by where i don't consider stealing them. i can't bear to be sober from anything and all i want to do is die or run. my only hobby anymore is counting calories and subsequently getting rid of them. i feel like a failure of a soul.

anyway, i just wanted to tell someone so i hope somebody reads this",1
What's good about me/my philosophy/ my ego,"Okay, let me find a different tactic. Normally I look at the worse things about myself and amplify them 10 fold in a way to prove to myself that I am these nasty things. I know these things about myself yet I still actively take part in my own destruction. The reason for that I can only speculate at the moment. Today, I'm forcing my self to speak good on my behalf.

I always have a plan A to Z, yet I know when to throw that out the window and just mad lib. I'm the guy who's down for anything. Saw both the Atlantic and the Pacific the same year because I wanted to see both oceans for the first time. I was broke so I just walked part of the way and stuck my thumb out for the rest. I lived in a commune once. That was cool! I'm not easy to anger. I'm not easy to scare. I stand up for those that I love as well as those that I don't. I'm well read. And I can cook very well. I mean my whole lifes philosophy has always catered to the idea that  rough experiences are the most important experiences to have. They gives us the best opportunity to overcome adversity and grow as human beings.

My point is even if it's true that I am some of the ugly things I say I am, I'm also all of that. I just need to tap into my younger self and learn from these experiences and move on.

Or maybe it's all my ego tricking once again that I'm better than I really am. I'll just leave it here before I get dark 😬

Maybe we can turn this into a moment? Maybe you can jot down some things that are good about you?",1
Welp,"I know this'll be lost, but I just kind of need to scream into the void. Nothing has gone right for me in years. I can't find a job, friends, or meaning. At this point I'm just going to end myself. 6th times the charm, right?",1
I feel like I’m mentally and physically drowning.,I don’t have anyone to talk too. I’m so lonely and anytime I try to talk to someone it doesn’t help because I get the generic “it’s going to be okay” responses that I swear only make things worse.  I am two months behind on my rent even though I work around the clock. I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I just wake up go to work come home sleep repeat.  I don’t have anyone around me unless I’m at work. My small amount of friends and family are kind of over being around a depressed person. I get it.   But I’m just so sad and I don’t know what to do anymore.,1
"I feel lonley when I am not calling people, why?","Since I grew older, I started to play different type of games. This way I started to play alot of solo games. I was used to playing Fortnite as a game and I had a whole friend group in it.
But since I played different type of games I started to play alot of solo.
I started to call with 1 in real life friend and I don't even know why. First we started talking about our life's and everything, now after a year. We are just joining the call and we are happy to be with each other, and my day kinda sucks when she is not around. I am a Male BTW. Since 2 years I have been in call with several people and just having like a phase that I want to be in call with person all day. 
I really don't know why. But I think because my parents are divorced and I am an only child. 
I am just coming from school and opening my house without any sounds, or any hello's because my mother is working all day. 
I feel so lonely and when I am In call with people I just feel great, does anyone know if there is a connection with being a only child? And the need to be connected with someone?",1
why am i still alive,"I mean seriously, born in a middle class family with an alcoholic dad who mentally tortured me from the time i can remember, a mom who ignored me all life and leaving this stupid family cost being alone in this world with no relationship whatsoever.
Loved a girl from highschool , but we didn't worked out. 
 I loved art and music as a child and i took engineering as my graduation because I'm 'good' at studies and had limited knowledge about careers.
Now I'm homeless, no love life, no family, no friends, trying desperately to get a job in my graduation which I don't like and I'm bad at. Even i get a job there somehow it'll be low payed while people all over the world making millions with onlyfans.
Depressed , anxious and terrible at even keeping a good posture.
Everything i ever wanted was a sweet little family, a lover, a job which i love to do, never happened in my life, looking forward from this moment, i have nothing to live for and Why am i trying to live, honestly I don't even get any logical explanation.",1
tired of trying,"Every time I try to get help something gets in the way. Was supposed to start Prozac last week and then suddenly my doctor quits, and the new one refuses to prescribe it until I've had a psych eval. The clinic I go to is extremely busy all the time and it's probably going to take upwards of two months for me to be seen. She wouldn't even give me an anti-anxiety to help deal with my OCD and the fucking panic attacks I've been having due to it. Nobody at the clinic has gotten back to me, and when I called earlier the nurse told me I ""just have to wait"" and that someone will get ahold of me ""eventually""

I can feel myself slipping again. It's getting harder to get out of bed every day, I can barely leave my house unless it's to go to work, and even then some days I just can't. I know I don't have much longer before I'm completely useless again. Every time my mood dips like this I wonder if I'll be able to come back again or if I'll just kill myself this time. Its to the point that I'm considering just slicing my arms up and calling an ambulance. The psych ward is one of my biggest fears but at least they'd have to help me get some fucking meds so I can at least try to be a functioning person",1

Feelings I want to express in a book but I suck at writing so I’m here,"I am nothing.

The same three words repeat.",1
Slice,"I’ve been cutting myself lately. It only sucks cuz I have to hide them all the time around ppl, wearing long sleeve or hoodies. I find some type of relief out of it tho so I kinda don’t wanna stop, but at the same time I know it can lead to more",1
idk (Also tw for my stupid feelings and want to end my life?),"I feel numb ig but it's not like numb numb? it's like all my emotions are taking a backseat and that there's just a part of me that is desperately missing something? I'm a a young adult, this year will actually be my 20th birthday and to be honest I plan on killing myself before then. I've planned several suicides that have failed, and I just hate how picky I am because I refuse to try overdosing or any methods with low probabilities of actual death. Self harming has been the only way I can regulate my emotions for years idk I have friends and family (even though my family is kinda shit) and things I enjoy doing, but I haven't actually enjoyed doing them in awhile. It feels like I've just been doing those things because it's expected of me... anyway no one knows any of this because I have horrible trust issues and any time I open up to anyone even remotely I end up having a panic attack. And it's hypocritical but I wish any of my friends would reach out or even notice I'm fucked but instead they just chock it up to me being me. It's my fault that I can't open up to others and while it's not the only reason I want to die the fact that I can never open up to and talk to another person about my feelings is a big reason. But really what could others do for me? I feel as if it would only burden them. I don't think I was meant to live. Obviously writing this is a sign that I want help? or maybe I just want someone to know, because going to self harm or suicide prevention lines seem pointless to me. If I open up to someone who knows me I'll probably be sent to a facility because of how at risk I am, I haven't been to one since I was a 17 but they sucked ass and never helped me. Idk I just want to stop living and at this point I'm getting desperate. I could say more, maybe I want to but whats the point right? There's also a very good chance that If I don't post this soon I'll end up deleting it. Thanks for reading this.",1
Hopeless,"I'm having depression for years now eversince the pandemic started. The apartment I live in looks empty as always. I work at nights and was woking at home up til March this year. There's no one to talk to properly since 2020 and I've hang on for two years now. I thought that going back to working in the office again would help, but it felt the same as always. Empty. 

I got friends to laugh with and act normal when with them, but everything is caving in once I'm alone again. I guess my demons will continue to bother over and over. 

I have a girlfriend, but I know she cheated. I know she doesn't love me anymore. Already forgot the last time she said ""I love you"" and the last time she checked up on me since we're on LDR. Tried to open up what I've been going through to her, but she just brushes it of as if it's nothing. She had her depression once, and I helped her through it - she's fine now. However, now that it's my turn, she wouldn't even bat an eye to ask whether I'm fine. I need her help, but she doesn't care.

Guess I have to deal with this on my own. This is hopeless.",1

Not only do I have an enormous amount of regular work to do, but I must do all of this while answering calls every 3 minutes while being socially awkward with my extreme social anxiety. Im literally crying everyday after work, sometimes before and during work. I feel hopeless and have never been at a job where I've been somewhat content and confident in my ability to work.

Self hate,I genuinely don’t like nothing about myself. I can’t even look in the mirror I just want to put myself through it.

Thursday,"I’ve been here a long time, on this group. In  happier times for me, I have encourage people to seek help.

I have sought help, I got through some bad times but now I’ve decided it’s the end for me. Not tonight, still got a few things todo. Need to make a will and write a few letters. Also I want to make sure my funeral is very small.

Thursday afternoon is d-day for me, I’ve booked a hotel away from my home town, to spare my son the agony of seeing the spot I committed suicide.

I’ve overdosed before and somehow survived, this was many years ago. I’ve decided it’s the rope for me. It’s weird but I’m so at peace now knowing my problems are nearly over. I know not to seek help or call a suicide line before on the day. 

I wish it was legal and I could find someone to help me do it, but it’s not. I can’t. I need to be brave for once. I suffer terribly with ptsd from Iraq and a personality disorder. How I’ve made it to 41 is a miracle.

I hope people find peace in life.",1

But deep down we all need a friend, a partner, and love, and nomatter how much we try to make ourselves okay with loneliness it will simply drown you deep someday. This is that day in my life.

sad girl shit,"I'm so depressed. I have fallen back into a really dark place again. Mercury retrograde has just ended. I thought things were supposed to be getting better. I feel so numb. I want to shower but it feels like a massive chore. The constant scrolling, the endless rage and restlessness, the envy and the guilt. I'm so lost in life. I'm a 23yo female. I feel like disappearing into the wild and ceasing to exist in people's minds. I sometimes get these crazy intrusive thoughts that make my heart drop, like taking out a huge loan I can never pay back, enjoying financial freedom for however long that lasts, then finding a peaceful and painless way out. I dont know what to do. My thoughts and my feelings are all mixed up and I am having trouble separating them. I dont know what's real and what isn't anymore. I feel like I'm drowning. I feel so insignificant. I feel like I cant feel anything.",1
I can't do this anymore,I think I really just want to die now. I feel depressed every single day. I have no friends as usual so it means something is very wrong with me. Being alive is truly not worth it and I wish nothing more than to be dead. I kind of want something very tragic to happen to me as I realize my issue with killing myself has always been the pain. I've searched high and low for painless ways to die but it's very hard to find. I just want to go sooner than later. I just can't feel this way for the rest of my life so it seems like it would be better to just cut my life short. I hate everything about me and can't wait for this all to end. I just want to rest for every. I'm tired.,1
I can’t take it.,"I’ve never felt more alone in my life, I’ve never been so isolated, and I’ve never wanted to not exist more. I’ve never not had at least one “safe space”, but I’m currently navigating, unable to trust or lean on anybody for any type of emotional support or guidance. I’d rather kill myself than live another day feeling like this.",1
Life feels like a constant struggle,"I've been living on my own for two years. Paying my rent, feeding myself, visiting my son when I'm able.

But every time I start to get ahead and save SOMETHING comes up and I drain my accounts back to 0$, or worse, -200$.

My house is full of trash because for the first year, even working a second job, I couldn't afford trash services. 

I sleep on an air mattress that's had a hole in for the last year, so I'm really sleeping on a pillow on a hardwood floor.

My first exit attempt was at 11, but I was revived.

I wanted to go off the grid, but with child support, if I do, I'll get a warrant.

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm never going to get out of this cycle. 

If I can't live for myself, why the fuck should I keep going?",1
Tired,"I am so tired of trying. Everytime I start to think things are good in my head my brain highlights everything I did wrong and everything that is bad. After 6wks of being on meds I finally felt like I could go outside. I did and felt fine until I realised that it's only because if the meds and I will be a slave to these chemicals forever if I want to be happy. I've been horribly depressed since, have not been able to eat or sleep. I'm a single father trying to raise a teenage daughter with no help from anyone. I HAVE to work or we starve. Been on leave and only getting half my pay, barely enough to pay rent so it's good I can't eat. Monday I go to doc again. I don't feel any better mentally. I'm afraid they won't let me go back to work. I am not sure how much longer I can pretend to hold on.",1
I’m just so tired,"Growing up I was abused by my dad,well I’m 19 now and I’ve been suicidal for a couple months now ,my dad walked out on me a couple months ago (well over the phone ) .He called me cuz he lived in a different country and he told me over the phone that he hates me and that I’m the worst mistake ever and he regrets having me .we haven’t spoken since

Well it’s been around a year in a couple of days and my life really changed for the worse . Growing up in an immigrant household and as the oldest sister /daughter I was the rock of the house . I was the mom when I needed to be and a therapist at times to my parents and to my sibling . I was never and emotional kid. I never cried or got angry I was always ( as my parents say )”the kid they never had to worry about “ 

For this last year my mom has been the sole provider of our house and she’s been doing amazing she’s having a really good year financially.But since the whole thing with my dad I’ve gotten overwhelmingly emotional,but only when I’m speaking to her . 

Everytime she speaks to me it’s bittersweet .im so proud of her but I just wanna scream “HEY MOM I WANNA KILL MYSELF HELP ME “ but I don’t  wanna burden her 
 
2 days ago my brother walked into my room while I was crying cuz I was about to kms (he didn’t know I hid the razor under my pillow ) and he comforted me and left my room 

The next morning I told everyone that my friend had killed herself and that’s why I was sad when in reality I wanted to off myself that night. The only reason I haven’t done it is because my brother caught me .

I don’t wanna leave my family notes or anything but I want to go it’s been too long if feeling like this im ready to go but im scared.my moms abroad so im waiting till she gets back so she isn’t worried in a different country .she comes back in 3 days 

I’m just so depressed all the time it starts to physically hurt sometimes idk what to to .",1
Depressing birthday,"It’s my birthday in a couple hours. I got dumped a week ago by someone who I thought was my life partner and I have been severely depressed since then. I have no will to socialize or celebrate or do anything other than be sad at home.

Can I call the hotline just to talk?,"I've been in a deeper slump than I have been in a while. My day to day relationships, and closest relationships, are being affected and I just want to talk to someone. I know the hotline is for those contemplating or for worried loved ones, and while I am contemplating, I know I wouldn't be able to do it. I wanted to see what other people thought about this so I don't misuse the hotline. Is it okay to call when I'm at an all-time low to have someone to talk to that will actually listen?",1
Depression has made me stupid,"God I used to be so smart. I used to read all day, everyday. I would read multiple hundred pages in a sitting. Now I can barely read a text. I'm not motivated to do so. It's not fun anymore. Not much is. Whatever. Depression and ADHD goes together like a gun a nosy kid: they probably shouldn't but just do. 

My recent bout of the stupid disease has not only affected my ability to read, but also other things like math. Or really anything ""academic."" I hate school. I used to raise my hand and answer questions, I used to love school, and it was something I was good at. Now I'm not good at anything. I know there's no point in reminiscing about ""the good old days,"" but I'd take being a clueless little kid who could read over being some fucked up depressed teen.

And finally, depression has also fucked up my memory. Not only do I not know anything to remember, but even if I did know things, I cannot remember them. I forget names, birthdays, dates, places, passwords, whatever. I have always had an affinity for being terrible at memorization, this is just the final nail in the coffin. 

Thank you for reading, kind internet dwellers, and I hope you are doing well. If not, feel free to vent about to me.",1
Feeling extremely low,"I’ve been feeling extremely low the past week in particular. Everytime i talk to someone (my mam or dad) in a normal conversation I want to cry. I want to cry when I’m alone. I am realising I have no personality and that if I disappeared for 10 years very few people would come looking for me, or question my inexistence. 

Im realising I have no personality becuase nobody ever remembers situations I have been in. For example, people often tell me a story where I have been in that story in real-time. I tell them and they are surprised. Or like with my friend in college when he said I never visited (even though I did COUNTLESS times). I was just background noise. I’m sick of being in the background. Nobody takes me seriously, so I become really serious. I am no fun. I never open up to anyone. I’m not friendly. I never invite anyone to my home or hang out with people because I am insecure that they will reject me. I am insecure about my home for many reasons. I opened up to my ex and then that didn’t result in good things ultimately. I am ashamed of my family. I don’t get along with them. I wish things were different. I daydream of having a supportive friend group. Or even a friend who cares about me and can be there for me no matter what. I see friends of mine (or atleast people who i thought we’re) go out together when they know I’m free. Or when I’ve asked them if they’re available they don’t include me. I always feel unhappy. It’s been for the guts of 2.5 years now.

I think one of my problems are that I cannot express my appreciation towards people and that ultimately drives them away. They think I don’t care about them. But I do. Then they don’t care about me. It’s disappointing. I am sick of being disappointed. 

Today I almost started crying in work. I fucked something up because my head was all over the place. Then I turned around to one of my coworkers and said something like “typical me”. And she looked at me and said what does that mean? And I wanted to explode. 

I think if I were to get the help I need a but i can’t because money is an issue and I’m living at home.

Universe on my shoulders,Lately I've been feeling tired all the time and feeling overwhelmed by everything happening with me.

Not A Day Goes By,"Not a day goes by that I don't feel pain and hurt, not a day goes by that I don't cry, not a day goes by that I dont want to end my life (some days it's a brief thought then my optimism kicks in), not a day goes by that I wish I could restart my life or at least be where I long to be, not a day goes by that I dont question what is true, is my life just a dream, etc. 

I just want everything to be okay, not easy, but okay. I feel like a curse runs through my veins since I can remember (4 or 5 years old) and I ask myself was it something I did or was I just born for pain? 

All my hopes and dreams keep getting destroyed or they seem like they'll never happen. I'm a 27(F) and wanted to be married by now, have my own place, be working from home doing writing 9r something I enjoy, etc. 

I think everybody has assumed I'm someone that I'm not and/or that I did things I never did or will do things I'd never do. Why? All my exes did that. Its like they never tried to really know me. 

I long for the right guy to say he loves everything about me and I'm good enough to him, where he'll take the time to get to know me  because he wants to know everything about me, etc. 

Only one guy has said that he loves everything about me and I'm more than good enough to him physically at least, we're more than friends (not fwb) though he said he's not ready to be in a relationship yet and I get that and said I'll wait, though he assumed some things about me and it hurt and I feel like no matter what I say, he may not believe me or see me for who I really am. Anyways, I've never had as strong of a connection, bond, and chemistry as I do with him and there's so many things about him that I'm looking for in the one (for lack of a better word). I really do love everything about him (aside from his fallen nature, if you will, because no one is perfect). Though sometimes and lately it seems like he's emotionless or distant and not replying back to most of my texts, etc. I'm just depressed about all that and about what to do, even though I've communicated with him, etc. 

I just feel like everything and the one I want is so far away and there's nothing I can do about it except what I've already done and said. 

I feel helpless and every day is pain. I haven't even told you about my financial and living situation, etc. 

Sorry if what is wrote is a little jumbled. Let me know if you need more info. I'm not particularly asking for advice as much as I'm just venting, I guess, though advice it helpful. 

P.S. 
I experienced trauma (sexual molestation) when I was 5-6 at least. I lost my dad when I was 14. My ex fiance broke up with me for reasons I still don't know over two years ago. My ex husband (after 3 months of marriage, thankfully) abused, manipulated, and controlled me/was controlling. I've had depression my whole life, I got diagnosed with high-functioning Asperger's when I was 20, on top of all that my family has always thought I'm weird in a bad way and tried to tell me how to live my life, what to do, etc. and there's been what seems like constant pain from breakups, to losing my jobs, to debt, etc. When I was in the womb, the doctors predicted there would be a 10% I'd live and if I did, I'd be born mentally handicapped, I proved them wrong though my life has been so much pain and depression and I have to work for things 10x harder than most people, that I find myself wanting to have died when I was in the womb. 

I just want hope that everything is going to be okay. I'm desperate for a breakthrough.

Hope you're all doing better.",1
"Feeling low, wanted to vent","Oh boy where to start. I've been depressed for years now, like many not every day is bad, but boy, when it rains it pours. 

I was doing fine for a while after highshool, had a job, some friends, my family, an all around average life. And then 2020 happened. I suddenly lost my dad to cancer in January, then covid hit, then my aunt sold her home (I lived there too, renting out half of it with my dad until he died), and then I moved into a 'friends' place that she was renting. That situation went south within a year and I jumped ship and found my own place to live. Now, my landlords are lovely people here, treat me like family, but ever since my dad's death, my blood family has just grown more and more distant, which fucking sucks, cause we only just reconnected when I turned 17 (my birth mother's an abusive narcissist who kept me from my father and his family for years, just to spite him. She's caused me a lot of trauma and pain over the years, and still does to this day).

And right before my dad got sick, I had just gotten a new job, which turned out to be an utter shitshow, awful managers, terrible hours, backbreaking labor, the usual for a warehouse job. And I've been on stress leave for a month now and time is ticking to either find another job or go back to that shit. I don't drive, so it's looking like I'll have to go back to fast food if I want to avoid the warehouse. And none of my family that I still talk to is being supportive, they sound disappointed in me that I can't or won't get a better job. And I hate myself for it to, but my mind is just so broken right now I just need something to pay the bills until I can put enough pieces back together again to resemble something human.

I'm currently in line for a therapist through my doctors office, thankfully. But I've had therapy from 9-19, and lemme tell ya, I've made like 8 of my therapists cry over the years. I'm really good at making people cry, I cry easily too. And I can feel what little progress I've made since moving out of my mothers house at 17 slipping away, my dad really was the glue holding us all together, I miss him so fucking much it hurts. I miss his hugs, his cologne, the warmth of his embrace and his stubble on the top of my head as he told me just how much he loved me. It's not fair, the good parent died, I missed out on so much with him during my childhood because of my mother, and just when things were going good and we were getting to properly catch up, he died. He left us, and now we're all broken, some worse than others. Both my grandparents, his parents, are still alive, and they couldn't even say goodbye in person due to the winter storms that January. I don't think they expected to outlive another one of their kids (my eldest uncle died as a baby), my dad was the healthiest out of all my aunts and uncles, yet he died first. It's just not fair.

And, just add to the shit sundae, I'd been working on weight loss before all this happened, and I managed to regain every pound I lost, so I've been fighting that on top of everything. Food is a comfort, but lately I've been going the opposite way, since I'm not working at the moment. I still eat, just not as much, but man some days I've been so numb I forget to eat until dinner. I've been in such a fog since going on stress leave, I used to never be able to sit in front of a computer for so long, I've been just so disconnected from the world that hours can pass by before I pay attention to the time. I should've been in bed hours ago, but here I am, crying my eyes out as the empty hollow feeling in my chest cries out in agony over everything I've lost. I want to run away, start over, but I just, can't. My pooch needs me, and I have too many possessions, many of which belonged to my dad, I'm stuck.

I just want a healthy brain, a decent job, and my dad. I'm so touched starved it physically hurts. I just want someone to hold me, no words, just human touch. I'm so lonely.

25 and burnt out.,"Every decision in my life has been forced by circumstance. I was conceived solely to entertain my older brother and became a ""mother"" to my other brothers at just age five when my incubator spat them out. Now I'm a mother to my own children, all three whom I absolutely love beyond anything and I just feel so guilty knowing if I didn't have them, I wouldn't be here. I self harm regularly. I have my learner licensed but my husband has no interest in teaching me/no extra money for lessons so I'm trapped in this small town. My husband (27) is so desperate to be a YouTuber and constantly tells me his stats and view count and I just do not care. I'm so blank all the time and it's so much mental energy trying so hard to be alive and engaged so that my children don't have such horrible trauma. My husband has no interest besides his YouTube, which today has 9 subscribers and more dislikes than likes as it's badly shot, odd music and weird topics. I'm so stressed and I know I'm just so deeply depressed that my medication/therapy just isn't scratching it.",1
I would like to understand,"Remember when i started to feel like this, i was like 12 ¿Who could imagine? There was a girl who pulled my hair to tease me at the school... But i never hurt her, i was a good boy, still a good boy. U know? A good boy does a lot of things, i can list some like: 
*cut your nails 
*keep your hair short(specially if they consider it ugly or u will turn to a joke)""
*u can feel sad, but don't show it to people
*""Empathy"" is a feeling, but in your case, it's a responsability.
*U will turn into an adult, no one prepares you for the fact that once you reach that point, u will not be considered human anymore and everything other people shows to you could be completely fake, just as if u were a patient taking a placebo to think they give u something that works to fix what hurts you, what makes u feel like shit. But there's not. You are all alone.

People talked me about ""male chauvinism"" as an answer for all those things i listed and the first thing i thought was ""hey, but what does male chauvinism has to do with how I feel like? Should i just ignore how i feel only bc it's a consequence of a social war?""

But finally that fucking question left in the air to disappear

So i never had friends in the high school. Reached the university like ""here it goes"" and as a ""here it goes"" should end up like ""it went fucking wrong"". I can't say if university were better, i think it was, but the feelings were the same, different thing was the contact with people, I've met some in the university i realized i wasn't lonely at all, there were other people who felt like me and that was great, but finally didn't fill the void, i stopped myself to think ""What the fuck am I looking for? Does the answer to this questions help me at all?"".

The answer to those questions were finally another one: ""What is actually not being alone?"".

So that's when a new phase of my life started. I call it ""make questions"".

I was a confused guy, but i wasn't stupid, i was looking for answers about human behaviour and i knew wich was the best way to find it: philosophy. Started to read a plenty of shit, Nietzsche is my favorite, but not exactly because i agree with his premises, in fact, it's because i do not. 
Thanks to Nietzsche, Descartes and Schopenhauer i just discovered that this i was trying to comprehend was not in my books, was not in my videogames, was not in the people in the outer world, not even in the stars, those i learned a lot about too. The difference was that now i knew where it should be: inside me.

The problem is that i didn't found it inside me neither, and i still can't found it. 

I have a beautiful family, people who worries about me. I also learned that people can love you even when they can't understand you, and that is still genuine love bc we can't read other people minds and they certainly cannot read mine.
I had a best friend, a wonderful girl i would give my life to get back, but the things that hurts us, also hurts people we love and also sometimes they take them away. I wish i could meet her in a new life, without traumas, without questions, without the feeling of never being here at all and not being alive.
""What if i tell you how i feel?"" Said once- ""i guess I can tell you I'm sad but what's the reason of that? Certainly i should know why the fuck im sad, bu i do not. And what if i tell you the reason is something u cannot do anything to help with? Yes i know, you will feel useless, u could just tell me u love me to lower the weight, u could just avoid me or fake you feel sad for me and finally pray for me to fall asleep, get tired and stop talking to you and then, u will deep breath and keep on with your life, u could die with me, but i don't want to take nobody with me, i don't want nobody to feel like this."" Finally... What if i just decide to disappear one day? Why would u feel sad? I hope once the day comes, everyone I've ever met just feel proud of me, i know very deep inside me that they never did, but if they just take a look inside their hearts and find me, maybe they would feel proud of how hard i tried to fit here, only thing i want is someone to look at me with those eyes people around me looks at their kids, wife's, husband's, brothers, pets... just after you all...

This week I decided to make a quick stop while running some errands and while I was ordering, I noticed that they were acting different. They treated me like I was just another customer when that wasn’t the case before. Today I woke up and found out they removed me from social media without any explanation whatsoever and I can’t figure out what I did wrong",1
My life is spiraling,"I don't know what to do anymore, my roommates hate me, I have zero friends and I should be feeling great at this point in my life, but I don't. I hate myself and can not make connections with people, I am not the main character of my life and I am ok with that, no one else is. 

I am seriously questioning if I just want to disappear and start over.

Edit: so here’s the full story (with details left out for animosity reasons) 

I live with roommate 1 and roommate 2 (both 20+ f). I knew roommate 2 prior but we weren’t close but we got along well and roommate 1 kinda mixed in well with us so it went smoothly. All of that changed when me, roommate 2 and my boyfriend were drinking and he suggested a threesome, nothing came of it and nothing else was said about it. Fast forward a few weeks roommate 1 wants to room with me and my boyfriend for the next year, doesn’t end up working out. Now this week happens and I go on vacation and ask my boyfriend to take care of my pets while I’m away (he just has to go 2 times for the whole week, 5 minutes each as they’re reptiles and he knows how to care for them). Roommate 1 text me this morning saying that I am a shitty person for not letting them know my boyfriend would be there (this is my fault as I completely forgot to tell them). I tried to apologize and say I wouldn’t cause any more issues which ended with roommate 1 saying I was disrespectful and had no human decency. 
I feel like a complete asshole and I do feel really bad. But I can’t change what happened and now for the past few months I just feel like I can’t do anything right by their standards. This does have a lot more drama to it and I know it’s my fault but I just don’t know how to fix it. 

Also my boyfriend is not abusive in any way nor have I ever felt threatened by him but he does have a lot of rough edges and he has some dark as fuck humor, which rubs a lot of people the wrong way. However he’s the only one that has made me truly happy and has supported me through my depression and still believes in my dreams even when I want to give up. (But he can be an asshole to other people, he has deep rooted issues) 

With that said I don’t see what the issue is if roommate 1 wanted to live with us next year but then freaked out that he was there without me. But I should have told them even though I didn’t intentionally not tell them, I really just forgot. 


Also for those asking why I have no friends, I struggle to talk to people and make connections that last. I do have a few friends but with all of us going to college we’ve lost touch so I just feel isolated right now and very much not welcome in my home.",1
It’s always when i need help that nobody is fucking there,"back in this hole again with what feels like no escape. and my birthday is in two weeks exactly. im trying so hard not to give up before then. but it’s too hard. my friends tell me to talk to them but when i try they don’t respond or don’t even do it in a timely fashion. almost like it’s not important. and it feels like it truly isn’t anymore to anyone. which is why i rarely talk about my problems now. im almost always there for them if not always unless im away from my phone. i feel so alone and they both know this but it’s like, nothing is changing. i feel like i have no place or meaning. im over it.",1

I can’t cry anymore and it’s making me crazy,"I feel horrible, i fucking hate myself, i hate my life, i spent most of my days thinking about how depressed i am and i still can’t cry anymore.

24M vet. Over the last 8 years or so I’ve changed from a driven, “idgaf”, carefree, happy person into someone who doesn’t know and is afraid of happiness. Nothing I do helps and even the small fleeting spurts of joy fade so fast that I’m tired of it. I’ve fucked every relationship due to past bullshit. And the last time broke me. Even the birth of my niece, something I’ve been looking forward to for years, it barely brought me anything. I wanted to be excited, happy for my family, but nothing. Everything is fake. I have to put on a face for everyone. The only person that knows half of it is my room mate. And venting to him doesn’t do shit bc he’s too lovestruck to realize what’s going on. I have a girl that’s into me but the about that it hurts to try and fake it to her is unbearable. She’s so good hearted and the only reason I won’t commit is bc it’ll be easier for her to loose a friend than a boyfriend. If and when that happens. My life isn’t the worst and I can’t say it is. Job, family, roof over my head and all that. But the inner turmoil is just unbearable. From the time I wake up to the time I go to bed is nothing but hiding what I’m thinking, trying to make everyone else happy, and trying to be the old me. But after 2 years idk how much more I have. Or even if I want anymore.",1
Think I’m done,"I’m over this. I feel hollow, broken, empty, disengaged, unsatisfied, alone and just quite honestly nauseous. 

I’m tired of the world, people. I’m tired of expectations, I’m tired of waking up and feeling like life is on repeat. Im tired of giving my all and feeling nothing in return. Im tired of the (sorry I’m busy) friends. 

I have reached a point where I don’t care. I don’t care what’s next or what’s after because this world sucks. I don’t care if I find love because it won’t last. I don’t care if I do something fun because it will end. I don’t care if I wake up. 

I feel as if I have overstayed my welcome here on earth. I know people are sick of me and sick of being around me. I feel like a shell and that I am just hollow going through the motions. I’m old news to people that know me. I’m tired of faking it with the “living the dream” stereotypical answer to the question “how’s it going?”. Im tired of taking a smile. Im tired of feeling that put in my stomach. 

This is the bluest I’ve felt ever in my life, I’m not sure how to or if it’s possible to bounce back. I just wanna move on and have people forget me.

idk what to caption this but hi I’m depressed asf💀,"I’m really not good at explaining how I feel so please bare with me but yeah I really don’t know what to do anymore. every day is a loop, weather I’m in college or not I’m living the same day over and over again. it doesn’t stop and idk if it ever will. I have days where I believe in myself and I have days where I don’t.
I don’t exactly know why I am the way I am but I’m pretty certain that it’s something to do with trauma and just shit I’ve dealt with in the past and I’m not even gonna bother getting into it because it’s too much. I’m so mad and I’m so upset for so many reasons I don’t think people will understand and to make matters worse my anger is bad too, which caused my boyfriend to leave me, not completely because he did say that we should quote ""break up for a while"" but I don’t know if he’ll come back in these next 3 months after I’ve worked on myself hopefully. I’m just scared, I feel so trapped and I fucking hate being by myself now. I’m always distracting myself by watching things or listening to music it’s just a lot it’s too much. I can’t even stick to the routine I’ve made on my phone that I promised myself I’d do I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what to do I feel completely hopeless.",1
I messed up big time...,"I'll try to keep it brief....just before Christmas I was placed on paid suspension from work for suspicion of theft. I work for a government liquor store and I have addiction problems with alcohol. There's alot of mental health issues in my family, everything from schizophrenia/bi polar disorder to manic behaviors and anxiety problems. I had hit an all time low and made some bad choices....since the suspension I've only told my SO and a friend or two and kept it mostly under everyone's radar...I feel great shame about all of it....i just received the email that it's time to go in and sit down with the company and I'm terrified....I've fought off some  suicidal thoughts and had some close calls....the past month or so i was able to get my mindstate  to a stable place but I'm feeling weak

I’m So Lost and It’s Making Me Physically Sick,"Edit: I’ve been depressed since I was super young, never taken meds and finally decided I’d try after being admitted. This isn’t just a couple of weeks feeling brought on by the moment. It’s been way over half my life now of dealing with my own mind as my worst enemy. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so lost and depressed. 

The only thing that ever made me happy in years was the man I love but he’s going through hard times too and recently left after three years of dating. 

I got severely sick physically where I couldn’t keep any foods or drinks down for three days straight, got severely dehydrated and had to go to the hospital just for them to put me on medications that are supposed to cut off the chemical reaction in your body that causes you to vomit so I could keep nutrients down but they stopped working.

I ended up getting admitted into the hospital where they put me on all kinds of meds including antidepressants and a high dose of sleeping meds for my insomnia but I have an adverse affect from them that causes me to just feel high and not be able to sleep. The depression meds don’t work anymore and I can barely muster up an appetite and when I drink something I just feel sick.

I’m so heartbroken, he’s all I know. He’s my home, the one I would go to for everything and the one I trusted with the world. All I want to do is sleep all day but I have terrible insomnia and the meds just don’t work. 

I can only hope he’ll come back? He’s the only thing that makes me happy and it’s been weeks of just tremendous mental thoughts and physical pain. 

I’m just ranting I guess, sorry for wasting your time.",1
Birthday party and terrified of no one showing up,"I call it a get-together because I think the term ""birthday party"" has been turning people off from wanting to come. I know, i know, ""if they didnt want to come, its better not to have them there anyway"" and such. But I feel like such a loser.

I dont think ive had a real birthday party since I was maybe 8. I wanted one this year, and was grateful that my parents chipped in because they knew this was likely the last birthday ""party"" theyll get to throw me since ill be leaving soon.

But... I invited six friends, and one cant make it, while two more arent showing much promise. I think, im just scared. Scared that-- if im lucky-- one person will show up, but even so ill still look like a loser. Im just terrified of their lack of appearance will confirm my fears, which are that they dont particularly care for me outside of texting every now and then.

I think what really irked me, is that no one really seemed... interested? Now, I mean, normally one wouldnt show a bunch of joy to an event where you have to buy something for a person and its dictated by their enjoyment rather than your own, but I just thought... maybe people would make more of an effort.

the two friends who are likely not coming, essentially said ""ill try to make it if im not doing anything."" And I know obviously parties arent a top priority, but, i thought maybe theyd at least be a bit more happy for me or something. Most of the time people dont remember my birthday, so this is really just making me feel a bit worse.

I just feel like a massive POS who doesnt do anything, whos kind of like the runt in the friend group where everyones pretty much alright with them fading out. this is so stupid; but i feel like a failure, and soon my family will see how much of a lazy antisocial bum I am if no one shows up to the event thats supposed to be my last.

I told myself that if i didnt get accepted into any colleges worth my future once i graduate, i would kill myself. I dont know how much longer I can wait for that though. My tests scores dont look that great, and im not very smart. Im just falling apart at the seams here, grasping at methods of escapism to avoid my crumbling self esteem and slowly fading social life. I just want to feel like im special one day of the year. Ive already got a friends' birthday present for them, and their birthday is in a month. I dont even know if they're having a party, but I felt like I should give them a gift so I got it a month in advance. So why cant they just show up for me?

I just want people to come to my birthday party.

Edit: Party was a great success, and like usual I overthought and made it a much bigger deal than it needed to be; 3 people came and it was great and despite some mishaps it was overall a great time. Just posting this to remind my future self that it does change, and at least see events play out, because sometimes they may be wonderful, instead of your worst fears. ",1
"Fuck it, I won't bother with bedtime anymore","Going to bed when its bedtime is so incredibly hard for me. No matter how hard I try and how often I fix my sleep schedule, it gets destroyed very soon.

"I'm 30, Lost, Stressed & Depressed","Hi everyone. Before you kindly read this post, just wanted to say I hope everyone is doing as good as they can today <3 Remember that you're valuable ok? Ok, time to share my story...

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and chronic depression (technically since 2009). I honestly feel like the most worthless human right now, with no direction in life, and totally lost with none of my life together... I'm a 30 year old man, living at home with parents in a semi-toxic environment (I'm embarrassed I still haven't moved out, and while they do support me, it isn't on an emotional level). I have a useless music degree, with no interest/passion in it anymore. Recently I've been looking for part time work, but with no skills/experience in anything except random customer service/hospitality roles, it's difficult. Plus, with family deciding to sell their house (which I totally understand why), I will either have to find full time work to survive on my own, or move with them, going further from everything... The whole process with 'work' overall stresses me out.

The only 2 things that keep me relatively sane right now, are streaming on Twitch, and my recent girlfriend. She's an absolute gem <3 Twitch can be discouraging though sometimes, depending on the viewer count... And my friends have all mostly been lost, so that part is also severely lacking... Overall, my interest levels are pretty low, and filling in some days without just going to bed early seem so difficult... 

It can be so hard to know where my life will go from here :( I don't want to exist, but at the same time, I've never lost that will to live... But living also feels like a purgatory, like I'll just forever be stuck in suffering... Which, I understand, part of life is suffering, right? Jordan Peterson talks about that a lot... I know a lot of men look to him for guidance these days... 

So I suppose, that's my life situation, in its basic form... I didn't think I'd be posting here, but, I felt inclined to do so, joining the others here who suffer deeply in this world :( And as much as I see all the hope and value in every other person... I just don't see it in myself :( 

Thanks for reading <3 Take care",1
It feels like I am trapped and there is no escape except death,"I hate when I cannot sleep , I want to but these thoughts keep on coming again and again , i honestly don't think I can ever be happy , I just can't remember a time when I had no worries or pressure about anything . I don't know what i want anymore , I just slapped myself and banged my head out of frustration . I always believed some higher spiritual power will save me , but I think such things don't happen . Only the person themselves can bring them out of misery , but I don't think I can ever save myself .",1
I can't do it anymore,"First sorry bad english or grammer its not my native language.
I can't get anything done iam enrolled in university for 3 years now I nether wrote an exam I didn't complete any of my courses in these 3 years.
I am trying to do better but I can't keep it longer up the a few weeks for example I am trying to clean my room now for a week straight and I can't do it I just do something other then the things I am supposed to do .
I am feeling like a big disappointment to everyone I know for example my parents who supported me all the way in every part of my life tbh I really don't deserve parents like them they are to good for me.
I don't find joy in the things I liked before it's like nothing can spark my interest longer then a few week.
The only reason that I not end it all is that I don't want to be a bigger disappointment to the people I care about then I am already am",1
I want to quit my job to focus on my writing,"I want to quit and just focus and pursue my dream of becoming an author. I’ve written four books, but they all failed and were too short.

But after that…..I don’t know. But I don’t care. I would rather lay everything on the line and fail and kill myself then, than play it safe, keep this job, and kill myself in a month!

Lost,"This is the only place I feel as though I can really say whats been on my mind. I feel so lost in this world.

I think about all the people I truly love and care for and how my decision will impact them. It's getting harder to see the point in being around. I'm a terrible person and I don't know my purpose here anymore. I don't have a reason to be here. I'm not looking for anyone to talk me out of possibly doing something, for once I just want to say it out loud. Everyone thinks I'm ok but I'm truly not. Anyways, thanks for reading I hope everyone in here pills through whatever you are going though. I don't feel like I will.",1
What is wrong with me,Lately I’m feeling overtly sensitive than usual. One thought of something that hurts causes me to tear up. Yesterday I cried for 2 hours straight after an argument with my sister and mom. I stay in my room in my bed all day. Fluctuating eating patterns. I’m always tired. I’m only happy when I escape into music or tv shows. I’m Second guessing friendships a lot too. I don’t think they really care about me they only text me when they need schoolwork. For the past few months I haven’t been happy. I feel absolutely nothing but like this deep pressure on my chest. I graduate in 10 days I’m supposed to be happy but I cannot stop feeling this way. I’m constantly arguing with my mom i’m so tired it’s like nobody is listening to me or even trying to listen. They write me off as having a bad personality and a nasty attitude every time i defend myself when they verbally attack me. i’m sick of this shit. Everyday it’s something and it’s always my fault. All she does is yell at me.,1
i changed school 5 years ago and i cant overcome it,"Okay so i changed schools 5 years ago and i don’t feel comfortable with this school since 5 years i also miss my old school and my friends when i changed i was like 10 years old and now im 15 but i cant overcome it so i kept contact with my best friends and other friends and we still talk but i also miss my old school every day sometimes when i come back from school y start crying sometimes all weeks and then i act like norhing happens this change was because the other school was too expensive but now my dad has the money but i think he dosent understand me and dosent care also one day it came to my mind suici$e was the only way to stop the pain because sometimes they laughed at me on school and they criticize me one day and other days, so in this school i dont feel comfortable with all and i dont have too much friends in 5 years but i still have faith that one day will be the day that i can go back to my other school that the thing i wish every birthday and everyday :(",1
Suicide is slowly creeping into my mind as the “only option left”,"I’ve been depressed for years now, but I never thought I’d be getting to the breaking point where I’m seriously slowly considering getting off of this earth soon and by my own will. 

I’ve never self harmed before or did anything to hurt myself, but recently I took scissors  to my leg once and found myself doing it again and again. Not too hard to permanently stay but not to light for it not to hurt. My literal thought process for a second was “I’m fine, as long as I don’t draw blood I’m fine.” Then it hit me rationally. No one should even be considering scratching and cutting themselves to begin with. No ok human should be even sitting down and looking at scissors as a way to take the pain away from your mind. 

I broke down on the shower floor after I fully processed what exactly I was doing and where my mind has dropped to. I just can’t believe that I managed to fall to the point where I even considered cutting myself. It’s just so painful now that I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so tired of fighting for nothing. The desperate need of just having someone to listen and understand that I’m not ok is unbearable. I don’t even have the courage to tell my therapist because I feel like she’ll recent me for not getting any better. She’ll tell my parents and then what problem will it solve? Just an ass chewing. I’m so tired. I just cant keep going like this",1
I just want it to end,"I have no one who loves me not even my parents, I get bullied in school and Im telling my teachers and the dean “if nothing is done I will defend myself.” And they didn’t listen.

One of my bullies decided to try and sexually harass me (14m) so my response was to sucker punch him, in the balls, and I got in trouble for it.

My parents just flat out ignore my existence, I went to ask my dad something and he thought I was a stranger in the house for a minute and almost pulled his gun on me. One of my brothers threatened to murder me and my parents didn’t give a fuck.

I just want to fucking leave and not worry about this shit

can depression make you scared of things you aren't usualy scared of?,"I went to a themepark not a long time ago and i remember that themepark from years ago as one of the best i have ever been.

so alone so tired so empty,"the alone feeling is very much, still here
the same suffocating, emptiness that i feel hollow within me.
And i still feel as though the only thing that would bring me ease is to end my life.

my attachment style is so distorted probably due to me never having a father figure, i recently got attached to a boy i met so recently and he just made me feel so safe and comfortable that i literally feel like i can’t go on without him but it’s so concerning to think this way so soon, because we met so so recently and he doesn’t  seem to feel the same and i feel so ..

i can’t explain the feeling , it’s like i’ve tried and tried to latch onto something to get rid of this empty and alone feeling but nothing is working and i’m losing hope

i need to kill myself.

i think i may be suffering with BPD, perhaps this is my attempt to getting answers for why i am the way i am, why i resent being alone so much, why i latch onto people so harsh and easily and why i lack self identification.

Is any of this worth it to me ? Like i feel like as i described i should lie down and die. The more I'm told to just get up and do things, the more i just back into myself like a turtle.

thinking too much? being depressed isn’t temporary happiness is.,happiness is what’s temporary. i would always come back to same hole all over again. i can have the best day then when i get home i get suicidal thoughts right away and i try to fight them but most of the time they’re just too strong (i did a deed yesterday and i hate to say it but i feel better now that i’ve done it bc i didn’t do it for the past 3 months and so many problems raised this was the only answer for me. at first i was drowning on guilt now I feel relieved that i’ve hurt me. i can say im working on it but what’s even the point when nothing really matters. I’ve become nihilistic and anhedonic. I cant be saved because my mind has been set about it. i find much more comfort on being depressed then being happy because at least i know depression would last but happiness is so uncertain. it will leave and come back. i been through all the help there is and im aware i need to be strong and work on this on my own now.

I've been having suicidal thoughts daily for 3 weeks in a row,"Hi, I've always been kind of a depressive person, anxious and everything. I have very low self esteem, I feel unworthy of anything or anyone good to me, I have very few friends, ""broke up"" with my bestfriend a few months ago, I have no girlfriend or lover, I spend most of my days in bed, etc...
I felt better lately, had a few activities around music, which is my passion, I managed to cheer myself up and motivate myself to go out, do things and all, but all of this stopped mayne 3 weeks ago now, and I'm not even sure why. Anyway, since then, I started drinking and smoking more being sober is too hard, I tried again to compose, make, or play music, but every time I tried, it made me feel like shit. I'm continuously losing hope, more and more, and every day, I feel like killing myself. I don't think I am suicidal, like, the thoughts are there, but I don't think I'd do it.

when it rains it pours,Just a rant but I'm a first time mom. Post partum one month and it's so hard in general. The lack of sleep and eating is awful but finally having baby is amazing.I have a partner that helps but he also works 12 hours night shift. I miss him so much. Yesterday my 12 year old chihuahua had a seizure for the first time and has fluid around her lungs. This emergency vet was $1200. The anxiousness I feel for my baby and fur baby is so bad. I have no friends and really nobody to talk to. I stay inside all day because it's so hot outside. Tomorrow I'm going to try to take her to a vet and save her if I can afford it.

What do I do?,This is the question I ask myself all the time. I have so many people in my life that help me and make me happy. But what do I do to help myself? How can I stop being so harsh on myself? I cry all the time because I’m aware of how I treat myself but I can’t stop. How can I forgive myself for all the mistakes I made in my life?,1
Can unfulfilled desires be the cause of depression?,"For example:

1. you want to have friends, but you have no social skills so you can't get any friends.
2. you want a job, but every time you apply it gets denied
3. you want a lover who you will marry with, but you can't find someone
4. you want to study, but every time you try you get terrible grades.
5. you're homeless and unable to get a roof to live under.

I find myself having a few unfulfilled desires that frustrate me pretty much, but are they really the cause of my depression? I think in the human life it is normal to have unfulfilled desires, everyone has them, but not everyone gets depressed from it?

Would prefer if a psychologist or other expert answered this question for me.",1

Can anyone relate?,"For the last few years I (19m) have been tired, agitated, irritable, and have lost my motivation and interest; life has become been unpleasant. Things got worse this past spring so I took leave from university and went to live back at my parents' house. I'm currently meeting with doctors who are trying to come up with a diagnosis, but the process is taking so long.

I feel like my head is foggy and I don't know what to do, nor what I'm supposed to be doing, nor if I should even be doing anything. The thoughts I come up with of what to do seem so tiring and ineffectual, I feel conflicted, and I second-guess myself. It all feels so exhausting and I just don't know what to do anymore.

Can anyone relate? maybe we can figure something out together",1
disability for depression???,"So my depression is once again crippling.... I am thinking about taking time off work to try and get my shit together for real this time... Has anyone ever gotten off on short term disability for depression before? Is it difficult? I know there's less of a stigma around mental health these days, but I'm trying to get my ducks in a row here before my Drs appt... I'm not sure if this matters, but I live in NYS",1
Am I the problem?,"So most of my life I was lightly bullied/heavily teased by ppl which made me change schools so many times. In 9th grade I begged my mom to homeschool me but she refused (its pretty difficult to register a kid to be homeschooled here). Finally high school came and it was great. I had my first relationship and my classmates were cool with me. However high school ended and everyone moved on, everyone except for me. I got broken up with right when I graduated last year which crushed me and made me extremely depressed. Not only that but the university I attended this year sucked. My classmates saw me as a loser and my roommates were nothing but bullies. I decided to drop out because my friend also did and they were the only good thing in that town (we went to the same school but not class, had the same flatmates but different rooms and roomates and traveled together there). So after dropping out I didnt do much but I got a part time job (since im still classified as a student) and I hate it. Like I have only been there like 2 times for an hour and im waiting for when Im supposed to come again. I really dont want to go and its stressing me out so much. I feel dumb for quitting so soon but I am planning to go abroad with friends to work so I would have to quit anyway. I still am afraid to quit though. Idk whats wrong with me, I try something new and it turns out horribly. I am planning to try a different university but till then I will have to work for a year and I really dont know what job I can do without being depressed. I have social anxiety and almost every job requires to work with ppl. I feel like such a loser.",1
i am so sad and lonely jesus christ,"i have no friends never had a girlfriend and i’m going to graduate hs next year. i have extreme social anxiety and was just promoted to being like pretty much the head waiter at my work (i hate it there ! :)) ((no pay raise!!)) i have missed out on the most fun times of my life and have little memories of anything i’ve enjoyed in the last three years.

all i have left is my music and i’m no good at it anyways. 

I really am at a loss i need someone in my life i can talk to like literally anybody",1
23 and in a bad position,"  I'm a 3rd child and i've always felt like my parents never really cared about me and my future. I switched two schools when i was really young. 

  In the 5th grade, my parents talked with someone at the school to find me a really good class (it was a math teacher keeping that specific class). She was very rough on kids but especially on me. She found out my parents have put me in that class because it's a ""better"" class. She spread the word with the other teachers so i can have a hard time. I had extremely bad grades, just enough so i can pass unless it was sports or english classes. Later on, i went in a sports highschool. This is where the fun began.

  I was skiping classes alot as the kids in there were awful.. everyone was fighting, insulting each other. i've even got headbutted and punched in the face until i was seeing black. Didn't press charges as my parents were scared i could've gotten into trouble later on with that guy or his friends. I had to repeat 2 years of highschool. Stoped at my second attempt for a year. Went into an ""afternoon"" highschool program so i can finish. Never took my final exam but i've finished highschool wich i am proud of myself. 

  In the past 2 years i've lost all of my friends. I have no one to talk to. No one messages me. I try to make online friends that like the same games that i play. Even that doesn't feel good. Even video games don't feel as good as before. I've gained some weight and i don't feel good with myself anymore. I can't sleep at night AT ALL. When everyone is starting their day, i am ending my day. I can't keep up. The only thing that made me happy these years; i lost 5 kilos in the last week. 

I don't know what to do. Where to go. Who to talk to. I'm very tired and hopeless.",1
Feeling stuck whilst everybody is moving on,I am 24 f and I have felt stuck in a miserable life and it's just getting worse. Everybody is moving on and I feel like I am going nowhere. I am working but not happy in my work. Not my career necessarily but where I work but I am struggling to start somewhere new because no one wants me. All my friends are getting engaged or married and I am just here... Nothing exciting happening to me. I feel like I am looking infront of me and just seeing everybody getting further and further in their lives... But for some reason I am making no progress.. I cry when I shower because then I can think .. and I am thinking I am just gonna be stuck and useless my whole life.,1
Tell me something you are proud of,"We talk so much about misery, even though we are so damn tough and badass for fighting depression everyday. 

We deserve to feel pride, so please share something you did that makes you proud.

EDIT: I love you all so much, thank you for sharing your pride! You rock!",1
Why ?, I have been in high school for 6 years now because of depression I go to like half of the class/leave in middle of the year. And now in my last year I am not passing it and only exams can save me but I can’t work because of my head. At the same time I look around me and find nothing interesting. I know I have people who love me ( family) but I still feel like having a hole in relation. I look in the future in fear not knowing how will I live? I don’t enjoy things. I want everything to end but at the same time I know how much it will hurt people around me and I don’t want to annoy them more than I already do. I am a 21 years old with no will to live other than not making my mom cry. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for more than 5 years and don’t see much changing. I have been taking antidepressants for 2 years and whenever I forget to take them I feel like jumping under the next train. Will I ever be able to live without them? I play PC or watch things to make the time past. Is this what millions years of evolving did ? Why am I here ? For what reason ? Will I ever accomplish anything ? I wish best to all people reading this and strength for their battle against this shit Paulo,1
so tired,"Of everything for so damn long.  Work is the only time I feel less depressed, sometimes even happy.  I do have work ethic and I like to be proud of what I can do.  It's just sad that I have to tell my supervisor how to do their job, just for them to not do it it and mess everything up.  Constantly.

I could go into management.  I'm so tired of it though.  Before this job, I've made management in every job I've had before.  Never worth the headache.

The best part of my day is work.

I come home to a messy house everyday.  Literal shit on the floor always.  Sometimes it's the dog.  Sometimes it's not the dog.  So depressed that I stopped caring decades ago.

My wife and I always argue about the same things every day.  I tell her it would be nice if she at least put her bra away cause our kids really shouldn't be handling them.  To put her bowl or garbage away.  Not stick it in the couch or under it.  I tell her that the boys are copying your example.

I tell my kids every day, when you are done eating, dishes go in the sink.  Yet almost every day I come home to half eaten dinner from last night being left out.  (At least it's on the table and not under the couch).  My kids can't even flush the toilet.  (I wish the older one would just put it in the toilet in the first place).  

I never wanted kids.  Sad to say, I have hit them several times.  Haven't for a while.  Purpose is to curb bad behavior.  Well bad behavior kept coming regardless so what's the point?  My parents beat me and I turned out into a fine consumer.

I never loved my wife.  I loved the things she did for me.  Clean, make me dinner, etc.  As soon as she got her first kid, she stopped.  I'm pro abortion.  She isn't.  Even though it takes 2, only one person gets to choose how to handle it.  And the other is stuck.  Either raising kids they never wanted or paying child support.

Honestly, I don't want anything but to sleep.  And there my wife is, sleeping 12 hours a day while I get 4.  5 if I'm lucky.  I didn't want to date her.  Just didn't mind her doing whatever while I did whatever.

Thinking about leaving.  I don't want to be the ahole missing father type.  Even though I don't like my kids.  I don't like myself enough as is.

5 years ago, we moved to another state to get a house.  We are still in the same apartment though.  

I think I was supposed to be smart.  7th grade I took my SATs and did better than 80% of high school and college kids who took it.  I used to correct the teacher every time they or the book they are using made a mistake.  I cut school for 2 months one time.  Came back to a test.  I was one of 3 people to pass, and the only one with an A.  Teacher said no body studied.  Asked about myself and she said I don't count.

I never mattered though.  Youngest in my family.  But oldest had hearing and depression problems.  So he got everything he wanted.  I literally got ignored.  We tried group therapy for him.  Some how it ended up being about how annoying I was.  Therapist has the bright idea of telling everyone that one I'm annoying, to just tell me.  For years, just walking into a room and I would get hit with that till I leave.  Just on repeat.  By everyone, including parents.  Nice to have 7 people say nothing but you're annoying for I think it was almost 2 years.

So yup.  Plenty of potential just wasted.  Went to college.  Tried saying I wanted to become a nurse and then a doctor.  Got made fun of.  Dropped it.  Dropped out of college to help pay for the family home that we lost anyway.

I could go on and on I guess.

This year we aren't getting a house cause since January, we have only had one income.  Mine.  It barely pays the bills as is.  Wife wants to do Uber eats delivery. I did it the year before with great success....  She literally isn't even trying.

Since January, not a single week of 40 hours.  She averages single digit hours per week.  I can count on one hand, how many weeks she had about 20 hours.  I showed her what to do.  She literally needs to turn the app on when she is home.   She spends more in gas then she makes.  I made 1k a week doing it.  It's called effort.  

She does our taxes every year and I let her have it every year.  This year I asked for 1k just so I can get snacks and stuff at work and not have to worry for a while.  Also wanted to get a game for the switch (Christmas present that the boys never play with).  This way I can do something else besides smoke and save money.  She keeps saying she will, but she filed in January.  Got 12k in February, and still keeps saying I'll do it later.  Every year, that's supposed to go to a deposit on a house.  It never does.  It's down 4k even though I pay all the bills and do the grocery shopping.  So much stuff that we need and never use.

Now our lease is just about up, and she has no work history just about this year.  So yeah, still no house.

And I leave for work, she is sleeping.  I get back she is sleeping.  4 hours later, she gets up and out of bed.  Since we have kids, the bed is like a time share.  Unless kids are sleeping, one of us is supposed to watch the kids.  When she is up, she tends to follow me around, including right back to bed when I try to sleep.  I wish we could leave our kids alone.  The oldest one keeps trying to get

I feel like I've always had the ability to do anything.  Just never had ambition.  I think that happened when I figured out computer graphics really were just like cutting a family picture up and pasting it on a picture of a beach and saying we went there.  (My dad literally did this).  Anyway, literally anything I tried, I succeeded in doing.  Commercial fishing?  Sure why not.  Grew up nerdy, time to get swole.  About to get in trouble for drunk driving?  Yeah right.  Literally half way through a liter of everclear (I think it was 90%) and I can still talk my way out of it.  Same with doing 110 in a 35.  (Never noticed them.  They surrounded my car when I did stop).  Still no ticket.  Problems with my car?  I even made my own script for an experimental antivirus.  For my computer.  (Watched a lot of porn back in the day).  I just can't find the motivation to do anything any more besides work, cook, eat, sleep.  If I could get away with just doing that, I would be so happy.  

Luck is something I can't just be good at though.  I can read my luck enough to know if a scratcher has a winner when I walk into a gas station.  (Hardly ever but I'm proud to say the few times I get that feeling, it's always been a win. Usually just my money back or a dollar more.  Only one time it was 50.  I can also read people in poker.  For real, almost down to the suit.  I quit gambling though.  Was up 500, and went all in on the flop.  I had k q, they had q, j.  I knew this before we turned our cards over.  I knew I had the better kicker and they only had 1 card in the deck that could save them.  Because 2 other people folded their jacks.  (Not that I saw, just read them, the way they played etc).  B word draws her jack on the river.  This world is not fair.  Even when you get good, it kicks you to the curb.  



Just took a test for mechanical maintenance at my job.  Didn't study, almost no previous work history with it (other than holding stuff for an engineer while they worked), and I'm one of a handful of people who passed.  Figured this way was better than being a supervisor for a change.

Btw, this is clearly more for me.  Not really expecting anyone to read a wall of text 

Friends and family, who needs them?  I have my kids until they are 18.  I tried so hard to help my bothers and mom.  People don't change.  I'm not going to change.  An a hole boards a plane in Chicago heading for new York.  What comes off the plane?  Still an a hole.  Places change.  Time changes.  People don't.  Friends, I'm very good at burning bridges.  I already have kids to take care of.  I don't have the time, patience, or cash to nurture and nourish a full grown adult.  And of course, more importantly, I don't have the will.  I hate people in general.  No one really cares about you.  They have an opinion on the things you do, say, etc.  Even nice people do nice things to feel good about themselves.  How does buying a homeless person socks show you care?  It shows you are nice.  Most people who help out the homeless don't even want to know their name.  They don't go want to get to know a bum.  If you really cared, open up your house and let them live there until they get a job and get back on their feet.

Guess that isn't worth that nice feeling inside.  It's easier to give them a hamburger while I'm already getting myself one anyway.  Then I can be nice and feel good about it 

Anyway, there are times when I just want to drive through a wall at 100mph with no seat belt.  I kind of want to put it on cruise and jump into it.  I don't know why I bother.  Why I still bother.  Nothing epic or even worth while will happen.  No matter how I try to raise my kids, they will still take after my wife.  No matter how sound my argument is, it doesn't matter when it goes through one ear and out the other.  

I hate work btw.  I hate that I would rather be there than home.  No matter what job it is.   I've had so many different jobs since I've started working.  More jobs than years worked total.  Every single one of them had faults.  Even had one lady accuse me of locking the doors and spending hours in the bathroom.  ( She said she saw it on video and when I asked her to show me, she all of a sudden couldn't find it.  But it's there even though I know my work ethic.  Some one praise me for doing a good job.  My dad never did).  Anyway all of these is better than being home.

I mentioned I have done commercial fishing.  Best job ever.  Out in the middle of no where.  Everyone leaves you alone.  Some one bothering you?  Tell them to f off.  Real men don't care and don't have feelings, etc.  But it really did feel like a family.  I was even crying when I had to sucker punch my crew to get them back on the boat.  (Retrospect it was hilarious.  Captain said no one goes to jail today by any means.  No one went to jail that day.  Told the cab to hold on while I kept knocking people out while crying and throwing the bodies inside).  But because they felt like family, I felt so s h I t t y for doing it.  Work ethic, always do what I'm told.  And literally no one wanted to go back.  I was drunk as well.  Felt like the only way.  I'm not still working there for several reasons.  The biggest one is money.  Old company got bought out by new company.  We always were paid on price of fish per pound after it sells.  New company fishing company bought their fish at bottom dollar and then resold it at normal prices.  So not only do they get a cut before we sell the fish, (40% roughly), but they nearly tripled that by doing it this way.  I went from grossing 15k a month to 5k.  They want to kill people with how fast they go.  Hooks coming at you at 3 miles ain't no joke when they are coming in 3 hooks for every 2 seconds.  The quality goes down severely too.  That's what hit me.  When I started, I was grossing 5k.  But I was half share.  Full would make 10.  As a supervisor, I'm the one who brought our quality up to each get an extra 5k a month.  And I was damn proud.  Considering the only instruction we had was a hand full of pictures.  I remember my supervisor yelling at me to look at the picture, lol.  I did that to my green horns too.  Does it look like the picture? No? Then you're doing it wrong.  

As a side note, one compliment I loved, no matter how backhanded ""damn look at you with that retard strength"".  Been smart my whole life.  Didn't get me anything.  Out there on the sea, none of that matters.  (Also didn't realize I was ""strong"" until this point.  Low self image and I grew up in chess and math club etc.  Always trying to get my dad's approval without actually getting it).  I paid more in taxes that year than he made.  Yet when I told him about it, he just asks when am I going to get a real job.  That's when I kicked him out of my life too.  I was happy.  Plain and simple.  And he wasn't happy for me.  Plain and simple.

I really do miss fishing.  This usually brings back my mood and has today as well.  Whenever I bring it up to the wife, she pretty much just nods or agrees and changes the subject.  Then I nod and agree without actually listening.  I get for her part, she wouldn't want to hear the same stories over and over again.  I do it cause her voice annoys me so much most of the time.  I tell her I listen better when I can read it, like in a text.  She usually ignores my texts and calls though.

And btw, she isn't a cheater.  Why I started dating her (besides food and cleaning.  Lots of girls do that to get a man).  I knew she would change with food and cleaning as well.  But she is devoted to me in a I care about you enough to love you and think about you and never cheat.  But you don't care enough about me to pick up after yourself...

Anyone still reading, find something that makes you just a little happy at least.  And nurture that.  Every day sucks.  I don't like anyone around me.  What gets me through most days are dreaming about fishing.   I also flex a lot now.

As a ridiculous side note.  I had bacne growing up.  It's bad enough on your face, but how do you get intimate when it's a surprise just to take your shirt off?  My best friend at the time whom I was in love with wondered where my confidence was.  I told her didn't have any cause of the bacne.  She asked to see it.  I asked her not to freak out.  She screamed.  Any self esteem I had that day got murdered.  I understand she didn't mean to, and she apologized.  Point is, don't let that one thing that brings you happiness be a person.  You control your happiness as best you can.  Don't let anyone else control it.  They can still hurt you without even meaning to.  


Bare minimum, keep up appearances and hygiene.  I'm missing teeth and it hurts inside to talk or smile.  I was depressed for so long that I didn't brush.  What's the point if even my best friend with fair warning screams from the sight of my back?  Downward spiral of depression from there.  Now I'm depressed about my bacne and smile etc   Just think of it as something you do everyday.  Like going bathroom.  Heck, do it while you go, who cares?  I know neither of us do.",1
Just stuck in this weird loop,"Maybe it's just cause my friends are taking care of themselves better, but I keep getting recommended videos on taking care of yourself (ie. Skincare, working out, eating healthy) and I just can't get myself to do it? Like I barely care about myself enough to do the basic needs, so this stuff feels so out of field for me sometimes. And it just makes me feel worse and worse about myself, which just loops all over again. It sometimes gets to the point where I imagine if I ever get out of this to ""live life"" there won't be much of a life left to live cause I've been shit to myself for a good chunk of it.",1
I feel myself self destructing and its like i can't stop it.,"I've been depressed since i was 5 and witnessed a childhood friend accidentally shoot himself with a gun when we were playing around. Life hasn't been easy for me and i can't seem to catch a break. However the past month or so we will call it, i've felt happy without some sort of crutch, like weed, or alcohol, shrooms, anti depressants etc. I've been with this amazing woman almost a year now and neither of us expected a relationship out of it. before meeting her i always just figured i'd pull the trigger to just end it because i genuinely don't see why people fight so hard to live. However now that i'm with her, i get the idea of it i guess. like i just want to see what happens next good or bad i want it with her.

However, i'm self destructing and it honestly feels like i'm not in control of my actions. it's not desensitization or anything but like, i would be searching for any attention from mainly women even though i'm so happy. i have staved off any attemps by just cutting out any women from my life right now because i don't want to ruin this with her. however it seems like i have switched to starting to get high more often, or drunk because of whatever reason i can think of. Friday was perfect and amazing and it was everything i wanted. and still want. yet it wasn't good enough for me so i had to go to a buddies house to get black out drunk instead of just going to bed with her. Wednesday night after an event i chose to stay home to get high. but it's like i'm trying to fight my own brain. like i tell myself no i want to go to her house, or i don't want to drink, but i'll look down and my body just does things. i don't know why this is so hard to be happy, and what the fuck is the point of it all if someone can't change, i'm trying so fucking hard to be just. ok. and it feels like everytime i start my brain starts to do something that ruins it or tries to sabotage myself and i believe its my subconcious because once again i just don't want to do any of this. 

the shitty part is, i see myself doing all this and am like okay bud, we need to stop, and my brains like nah man, down a box of wine and see how fucked up you can get then go driving home when you know damn well that you shouldn't and i just want to be normal and okay, and just not have to fight every waking moment of my life to just not be sad. i'm so tired of it, and i just want it to end.",1
I feel empty,Ever feel like you're hollow inside and you just don't want anyone to know that you're suffering cuz of judgements,1
Always back where I started,"I had this thing when I have depression I just sooo desperately want to be fine or happy that im obsessed with it. And I counted the days or months when I was depressed and when I was finally happy or fine I started counting those days as well and these ""happy "" days usually lasted like 1-2 days or sometime just a couple hours when I for sure thought that 'ah yes this will be it! I never ever being depressed again bc how happy I am now that it just can't happen again.' And for sure those happy days were gone.. always gone and I felt that they (happy days) are never coming back again. So now I just realised that I'm so obsessed with being happy and not be in depression for long time that it has just no sense. It really has completely no sense for being so obsessed with stg that will last only just 2days or less and then it will be gone for months again. So my realisation is that I can/should accept it.. the depression and all the shitty things with it bc eventually it will come back no matter what so if I live with it why should I fight with it when I should just accept the fact that I will never ever be happy again and the depression and the endless sadness will be there for me forever. It's like I know it and I just started ro feel safe with it and it feels like home now.. its like I like being sad or depressed bc it is for me like it ""can't"" hurt me.. happiness can hurt you so bad just the thing that it won't last long for me than a couple of days than why would I want to be so happy? It has no sense, I know the depression and its not new whenever I feel like yeah this is it i finally found the key to happiness or the key to progress it never last long so why don't I just live with it? I don't want to die. I wanted for sure for a long time but I realised that I want to live . Bc I love being here I love the thing that I am here and I no more want to die honestly. But I also no more want to ""cure"" my depression. I just want to live. And if it'll be like that ,that I'm always sad than its fine for me. 2-3-4 months and I can have 2 happy days than its okay for me. I will live my life Idc anymore how but I want to live without counting the depressed days, this is my life thats it.",1

"I have been quite depressed recently, and the fact that it is now summer break makes it worse.","I am 15 and turn 16 in three months. Throughout the last couple of months I have noticed a change in my mindset and the way I feel on a daily basis. I have started to feel like the things around me are now more ""fake,"" not as colorful as they once were. Two days ago I was at my high school's graduation, but I did not feel bad about my senior classmates leaving as much as I used to. It's like I feel almost no emotion for them now even though I do care about them. I have felt less interested in doing typical things, as my mind has found a way to make virtually every activity humiliating in some way. And I do not have any friends or trusted family members that I can turn to for personal matters. Instead, the best I can do is be a friend to myself. That usually works out, but going to school in person has made me feel more alone than ever, considering every one of my classmates is in their own friend group and usually does not seem to care enough to talk to me. I feel like a ghost that no one notices, even when I am right next to them (except for a few teachers/staff). At school, I also felt that I am nearing a relapse of the anxiety I had last summer, especially on hot days. It's complicated, but I had a lot of health anxiety last summer due to an experience with dehydration from a year before that, and was also dealing with my mother's violent transphobia after her friend had just told her about me without my knowledge.

Yesterday was my first day of summer break this time around. It felt like such a long day, and I don't know how I will be able to take going through every single barren day in this over two-month-long period. My mother came back from work yesterday during a moment when I felt a random need to cry, so I had to go into my bedroom to cry a little without her knowing, as seeing me cry makes her angry. I already know the summer weather will be draining; it has been very overwhelming during my time running outside for PE. And I have a feeling that unlike last year, when I had to preoccupy myself to prevent a panic attack, I will have to preoccupy myself to prevent boredom and maintain my sanity.

Sorry if this is long, I just needed a way to find people to tell about what I have been feeling. Maybe some people here understand what this is like.",1
Can anyone talk to me please. My life is complete shit,"Dealing with depression, social anxiety and traumatic experiences in the past is enough. Now having to face up to a chain of unfortunate events is unbearable. I don’t want to seem like a victim but I can’t help wondering “Why me?”. I’m so tired of this life. Can I have an advice? Or at least someone to confide in?",1
im sorry if youre reading this,"i just really need a vent sesh rn and i have nobody thatll listen.

ever since i was a kid ive seen nothing but pain suffering and futility. i feel theres nothing left for me. not here. not the mext life. not anywhere. nothing brings me joy and if it does it doesnt last long. i used to drown my sorrows until that stopped working and i was just a washed up drunk and depressed dude. after that i cleaned myself up but i got back into the cycle. instead of being a drunk i became a stoner and still am to this day. it doesnt do anything anymore. it stopped a few days ago. i just feel tired and depressed. its not like it used to be when i could just laugh and vibe through the nights. no, now im alone. completely. i feel so isolated. i feel abandoned. i feel like everyone i encounter and become semi close to treats me like little more than as if they were a child who got me as a new toy. for the first few weeks or months im amazing. im so entertaining and great to be around. then i lose all forms of novelty. i cant stop myself from clinging on to any single person thats willing to hear me and listen. its to the point where im falling in love with people over the internet in one conversation. i see videos of happy couples all the time on tiktok and being shown them and it hurts. i broke down when i found one. it wasnt a couple, but a lady laying in bed with text thats seemingly sporadically placed and more randomly timed showing up just long wnough to read and it had affirmations. stuff like ""its okay, you can rest now"", ""ill be here for as long as you need"" and it was the thing that pushed me over the edge. it reminded me that im alone. that ill never have what i truly want. i never have nor ever will. i told people during my edgy phase that people run from me because my love is like a disease that spreads and deteriorated everyone it comes into contact with. im starting to believe it. everyone ive ever loved has done nothing but mentally deteriorate after meeting me. it all feels like my fault. my earliest memory is drom when i was three and its about a minute long but it haunts me. its a minute straight of watching my dad beat my mom for her to grab something and hit him then him leaving. i remember her blemishes so clearly. the spider-web shaped blood running from that gash in his forehead to his chin. i remember it all. ive seen nothing good come out of this world. i dont even know my own role in this life. whats the point of living if i dont know why im doing it? i have no objective. i have no goals. no hopes, no aspiritions, no dreams, its all been stripped away from me. nothing feels safe anymore, it hasnt in years. nothing feels like home. i cant convince myself that everythings okay. i feel like im nothing. im told not to kms bc ppl would miss  me but honestly how can i believe it? why should i? everyone else thats even muttered those words to me have left. just like those people, more continue to come and go out of my life. im sorry this is so long ill shut up now i fee bad plus my eyes are watering so i cant type wel much longer. if youre reading this, im sorry you sat through my rant.",1
18 looking for help while venting,"I was first put on meds for depression and anxiety by a doctor(walk in vist) a couple years of ago. I quit those within a month and a half cold turkey due to side effects that I couldn't handle. I've been in therapy for around 5 months and have told coaches which have always tried to help. My family knows but everyone in my family thinks it normal because everyone suffers from depression, anxiety, and many more mental illnesses. My home environment isnt the best with an alcoholic narcissistic father from a small village  in Mexico. He and others in my family came here and survived through crime but my dad never did it for money just pride which hes told me many times. My mother is still young at heart, I can see it which makes sense because of having her first child at 19 then being widowed a few years later. Her being young at heart I can deal with. The manipulation, chaos, double standards she could bring I can't. I can't handle either really Its like im walking in a sleeping snake pit because im waiting to get bit from my  mom lying for sympathy or my dad trying to boost his ego. I've played sports since a young age and always being slightly taller than average and being athletic for my age landed me on football,basketball, and track rosters(going to run in college). My parents never went to many events, my dad probably went to a dozen of these over 6 years while having days off to go. My mom was better she went when she could and always brought others if she could. Recently I lost a close friend who i grew up with and played mutiple sports was killed in a drunk driving accident. Im not really over it because I never processed the other deaths in my life. Anyways I had to compete at state with these feelings they didn't affect me negatively but after my last race it defeat brought emotions and does now thinking about it. I never really cry in general especially in front of my parents but i couldn't stop myself on the floor that was over looking the stadium. My parents and family tired to help in there own ways and it showed me they care but can't show it. I know they love me but they never show it because of their mental illnesses and their own troubles. Its just hard to love someone who constantly compare their bad lives to the amazing one they have given you. My dad while drunk has always told me how he hated his dad for never showing support or love and how he was an alcoholic asshole. My mom is a badass tbh she worked from a young age and grew up just as her mom was immigrating legally to America. She grew up poor redneck that loved to party and has told me stories. Yet here I am forced to work from a young age with getting my first job at 11-12 which was unpaid. I was forced to wash dishes and help serve food because my mom was doing more than what she was paid for and needed someone to help her run the restaurant while she ran the bar. So it was me and my sister in the restaurant  and my mom in the bar with my lil sister sometimes joining just as a cute face. They were both paid while i got nothing not even tips and even got yelled at when asking when I was going to be paid. While we were working my dad was in the bar drinking and my shift would end whenever he was to drunk to walk so I could help him home.

I know I have issues and it takes time to heal and recover but I have a life to live and want to take the right steps. If anyone has tips or anything at all that can help it would be greatly appreciated.

Also sorry for grammer I randomly woke up  and wrote this",1
"Psychologist gave me activity list, I end up liking almost nothing on the list.","More than 100 activities on the list, and I have to say how often I do each activity and how much I like doing them.

i don't remember the last time i brushed my teeth lol,"the title basically sums up this post. now that im thinking about it, i should probably go brush my teeth but holy shit. it's a miracle dentists don't have a brain aneurysm when they step within 1000 yards of me.",1
Always rejected.,"With reason. I fully understand why everyone leaves me and think they should. It just hurts so much. I’m so lonely and because I am the way I am, I push people away from me. I’m backed against the wall but not because of others. That’s the worst part. 

I don’t know what to do and honestly I can’t be bothered to. I just want to sleep or stop breathing. Everything is too stressful and doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon.",1
I've never been loved,"I was raised in an abusive environment, got bullied a lot at school. Nobody cared, they were too busy. I'm now a high school dropout. I'm almost 20. I've never been loved.

I spend all my time alone.",1
drinking never helps 🙃,"Hitting the bottle just kinda brings all of the emotions back, like I remember why I'm in the position I'm in. It was all my fault in the end I deserve to me alone. No matter how many people I surround myself with in the end at the end of the night it's just me, myself, and I. It fucking hurts because I never want to bother anyone around me especially when they admit they hate seeing me in this state, but there's nothing I can do about it. I refuse to take a pill to make me feel ""happy"" because in the end is it really real. I feel like I should've been but on meds 10 years ago, but my family never cared for that, but here I am now.. hey tomorrow is another day I guess. Sorry for ranting.",1
Staring at the ceiling in the middle of the night has become a reality.,"How did I even get to this point... I wasn't like this, I used to be a cheerful kid, always full of energy and excitement, I was so positive, always laughing and seeing the bright side of life in every given situation. Yeah I had some low moments but they'd go away in like 2 or 3 days and I 'd go back to my original self.

the last 2 or 3 years haven't been easy on me, nothing goes my way, went to college and every friend I made there abandoned me, now they all avoid me, if only they gave me a reason or explanation I would've maybe understood, but no, straight up ghosting, the girl I loved the most played me for 3 months, never let me ask her out although she knew how I felt about her, only to throw me away for my best friend, who started making fun of me and eventually abandoned me and took all my friends with him because I'm not as cool or interesting as him.

I tried making new friends, I really did, I tried absolutely everything, talking to people in campus, roamed the city to find new people to befriend, even searched on reddit, social media, etc...but still nothing. I met a new girl but quickly understood she wasn't interested in me whatsoever, she didn't even see me as an acquaintance, and turns out she was interested in my former friend too.

I became friends with only one person person in campus, but as time passed and I started opening up about my life, they ghosted me too. It seems like anytime I get close to someone or just try to befriend them, they either avoid me or leave me.

I know I'm not particularly in shape, I know I'm not handsome or attractive, I know I'm boring, but not to the point of being left out, I'm not a monster, I'm a human being with emotions just like anybody else, I'm not asking for much, all I want is to be treated with respect, to have some friends and eventually a gf who'd understand and truly care for me, in short, I want to be like everyone.

All I do is study for my exams, spent hours YouTube and Twitter to forget about my life, listen to grunge songs and stare at the ceiling at 3am while listening to songs like ""Letter to Jarad"" and slowed doomer edited songs with tears falling down my cheeks until  I eventually sleep. 

I don't feel alive anymore, I'm just existing, a waste of space. I don't have any reason to live, and therapy isn't an option for reasons I don't want to talk about. The only thing that's keeping me from ending it all together is my religion, otherwise I would've put an end to this misery a long time ago, and I sincerely don't know if I can go on anymore, I might reach my limit this summer and ultimately pull the trigger, this way I'll finally be at peace.",1
Lost,"does anyone else feel completely lost lately? i feel like i’m loosing my mind. no motivation, energy, or feelings. i’m just… here. i’ve definitely had my episodes of depression, but this has been the hardest one to pull myself out of yet. if anyone has ever felt like this do you know how to help??",1
A burden,"I for the first time in ages managed to get myself somewhat back on track. Got away from a toxic friendship and met some very supportive people they say will continue to be in my life no matter what. I still struggle and feel like I always will do. I don’t want to burden them by being the “depressed friend” they need to be cautious around. They say that it’s not that way but I don’t want to hurt them by being like this - I wish I could do better and be a better friend and the only way I feel I can ensure that is by cutting them off but I really don’t want to. I get jealous easily of how easy they find it to go out and enjoy stuff, I’m always invited but can’t get myself to go usually. I know the problem is me.",1
Just got fired,"I just got fired from my dream job. I was only there 3 days, got fired on my forth.  All my family and friends were so excited for me, and I have no idea what I'm gonna tell them.  I just wish now more than ever that I was never born. I don't know what I'm gonna do",1
I'm giving up i can't take this shit anymore,"Everything around me and anyone who enters my life just dies I haven't felt anything but hate and anger since i was forced to watch my best friend get his skull bashed in with metal bats we were best friends since kindergarten too. I am sick of seeing that play over and over in my head and not only that but soon after that i witnessed my uncle die due to a hit and run and i have just lost so many fucking people I'm done being alive just to have everything i care about taken away from me everytime i try to enjoy little moments something bad happens I can't catch a break ever and life won't let me fuckin die either i have tried to succesfully od 5 times, i tried hanging myself, jumping off a high place, slitting my wrists and nothing fucking works! I am sick of just being alive just to be a walking bag of trauma. I have had 5 therapists been to social groups none helped and I can't focus on school or anything i am so lost in this fucked up world and i find it so hard to believe when my new friends say they love and care about me and say good things about me but they don't know the shit i done in my past that makes me the bad person that i am I don't know if i love anything and idk if this is a suicide note or a vent i haven't decided yet.",1
What should I do?,"I feel like I can tell something is wrong with me but I cannot pinpoint the problem.

I feel incomplete and I don’t know where the absent piece is. I want to be in control but I feel like I am not and struggling to gain myself back. 

I am trying so hard to not let my darkness consume me, I know I am not the only one in pain and can’t figure out why it’s there but i want to solve it.

Sad reality,I’m laying next to my gf right now but she doesn’t know in a couple months I’ll be dead and gone she’s been with me thru this past year and half of my rock bottom but I’ve consciously made the decision to start giving my things away and prepare for the next world my bsck is against the wall and i just want my life to be over honestly Totrd of suffering from finances and mental health issues major depression is truly no joke,1
Voices in my head (TW harmful thoughts),"Ive been hearing multiple, different voices in my head for a month or two and I was wondering if anyone experienced/experiences something similar. When i get into a sad episode consisting of crying and releasing pent up feelings, ill begin to hear voices telling me to do a lot of things.  Most of the time im in my car, a safe space, and one voice will convince me to lock myself in, another will tell me that my biggest fear, zombies, are coming to get me which furthers and convinces me more to lock myself in my car while another voice tells me to drive to the mountains and hide from everything. Along with those voices, I have the few belittling me, putting me down, and the other ones vividly describing suicidal/harmful situations. I am on multiple medications for migraines(nortriptyline) and prozac for my depression and would like to know if maybe someone else has had this happen to them",1
Any advice,"I’m 19 female and while I’ve always had anxiety I’ve never have or had experienced depression and it sucks. I get crying spells, I can’t sleep cause I’m too sad and when I wake up I’m sad also. I only sleep about 4 or so hours and even then I take over the counter sleep aids. I just feel hopeless and alone and like no one gets what I’m going through. On the other hand I feel like it’s not real and I’m making it up. I’m not sad all the time just most of the time, and at night or even during the day I think about suicide but it’s not something that’s logical or realistic for me so I don’t think about it or mention it to any if the health care providers I see. I feel like because I’m function nothing seems urgent because I get everyday people think I’m fine but I’m slowly dying. I’m not motivated and I can’t even begin to think of the future because when I do it makes me sick . I can’t do any of my favorite things and every day feels wasted. I do try but nothing gets better. I find a doctor they cancel my appointment or the insurance doesn’t take. I go to my job About accommodations or options and they give me the paperwork only to say they don’t accept it. I try journaling again and that same minute my turtle dies. My brain only things in negative and worse possible outcome.

I feel trapped most of the time and I’m so tired. I want to leave I wan to go away. I want my old life back. The worse part I can’t even begin to describe this to my mom. She thinks I’m grieving a 5 year old death or get depressed because things don’t go my way. But even having a support system sucks because I can’t tell her everything I can’t help because I can barely hold myself together and I know I’m taking a toll on her. I’m trying to be strong but I’m tired. I just want to be alone in a locked room without anything to do. 


My mom says this is a journey but I want off. I don’t want to keep going to different doctors and taking off work and not having vacation time and dealing with that stress. I don’t want to die I don’t think but I don’t want to be alive. I’m not strong enough I don’t want to be strong enough. Every day just has another disappointment and I’m sick of it. I know it’s childish but none of this is fair. I don’t know why this happening to me and why it’s getting worse. 
I found psychiatrist who recommended meds but I don’t want to try something and it not work and I don’t want to feel even worse in my body than I already do.
How do I overcome something when I just want out. I don’t want to keep feeling this horrible but I just want to stay in my bed .

I just sit and watch the time pass me. I don’t watch tv anymore, i don’t eat anymore, I’m way looser with hygiene, I don’t journal, no new projects or hobbies. Everything they was fun feels like a chore or distraction. And above all even when doing nothing I’m not relaxed either that or I’m just numb and tired. Nothing interests me, I sleep all day, and when I do feel even a little happy something bad happens and I’m back to being numb.",1
The loneliness of it all,"It's such a familiar feeling, knowing you're spiraling and shutting yourself away. As soon as it hit me I knew, and I was so upset. Because I dont want to be alone, I dont want to sit with these thoughts that make me so miserable. I dont want to be reminded of how while everyone goes and lives their lives, I'm stuck here. I dont move forward or backwards. I'm just here. 

And I hate it. I fucking hate it when people talk about this shit and try to make it relatable, it makes me irrationally angry. It's like they dont remember how it feels, like they forgot that it's so lonely. Theres no one to turn to, you just have to wait until it passes, or you make it so its over.

I'm so sick of people acting like this is fun, like it's okay to ""hashtag wanna die."" it's so miserable. I'm terrified for my future, I feel as if my family and friends are so disappointed in me that maybe I'd be better off no longer in their lives. It's like it feels like everyone dislikes me, not excessively so, but enough to where it feels like their love has been a lie. 

How is this fun? How is this something you can make a quirky video to? Am I insane?  To me it's not coping with humor, its undermining how achingly lonely and terrifying it is. It feels like you have no one and nothing, there is no where to turn to, no one to help. I fear rejection or their lack of response, because thatd be worse than not telling them at all. 

I just wish I had some semblance of normalcy. I wish I didnt shut myself in my room so often, I wish I could be some normal fuck up who does dumb shit with friends and falls in love. But I don't do that. Instead I sit here, knowing it's safe, and that there really is no other option..

Instead of spending my money on movie tickets or shit food to hang out with other people, I waste it on meaningless material items to help give me that few seconds of gratification, until the loneliness sinks in again.

I did it to myself. I did this to myself and I dont know how to stop it. I cant take myself seriously, cant imagine telling anyone out of fear of how idiotic I sound. I cant even imagine muttering the word ""depression"" in reference to me, it sounds so stupid. 

Just wish I had the drive to fix this, to stop the terrifying loneliness of being with myself forever.",1
The Last of Me,"As this is the last time staring at a mirror,
It shall also be the end of me
And the end of my kind
A smile is creeping up my face

To shine a light on the darkness,
That haunts the deepest parts of my heart
But I can not allow it to
I have no reason to smile. Why should I?

No reason I should be joyful
Why should I celebrate life when I'm about to end it?
This life's not mine, so I'm not entitled to keep it
You care so much for me and yet, 

I don't think much about myself
So why do you bother?
Why do you care for me?
Am I that important to you?

Do you love me for real?
Or you're just like everybody else?
A user and a manipulator
Why me though?

I don't love you!
Or maybe I do?
I don't know
I guess we'll never know. Goodbye!",1

No friends, except for two people on this app, no family, I have my dad, but that’s it.  He doesn’t know my pain.  I gained 10 pounds because of my grandma always wanting to go to a sit down restaurant, so I HAVE to eat with her.  So now I have to lose this weight all over again.  I got no sleep the night prior, and I woke up today, realizing how badly I didn’t want to wake up this morning.

Now I have to leave for work in 20 minutes or so, or I could just leave early and sit in the empty break room and find some solitude.

"Anyone else ever have that one teacher, whether it was college, high school, or even elementary, that just gave you a reason to live when u thought u had nothing left?","I have a physics teacher. I didn’t think I would make it through this year and yet here I stand, and I’m giving my physics teacher every single ounce of credit. My physics teacher saved my life, and I know it sounds dramatic, but this man truly showed me what a real life blessing of a human being he was. He was the first person who truly asked me if I was ok in over 2 years or more. Not just a “u ok? Yeah? Ok” but pull me out of the class and genuinely tried to understand type of ok. He made me feel included, he made me feel less alone, and I value that so much in human character. Even on the worst days where I could barley even look up, he would always walk over and try to make me laugh and wake me up a little bit, and because of that it was literally impossible to ever feel down in his class. He acknowledged my accomplishments in his class and made sure to always show me that he valued my effort and respected me as his student.  For a subject that many find so difficult and bull shit, my teacher truly made physics the most enjoyable, interesting subject I’ve ever taken, and that’s a lot judging that I’m shit with numbers. I don’t have the words to tell him how much I appreciate what he’s done, and I wish people respected him more for it.

I hate how Depression makes you feel.,"Mental illness is like being a prisoner of your own mind, now and again you're allowed out on day release, maybe even for just a few short hours, then BAM, back to the cells for you.

I don’t want to exist,"I don’t want to exist. I was watching a lot of videos about the idea of not wanting to exist because I have been thinking about it for a long time. I don’t think this necessarily correlates with depression or a mental illness. But I have no idea where to post about this feeling. Rather than wanting to commit suicide or anything, I just want to sleep and never wake up again. Sorta like what happened in The Avengers where Thanos snapped and 50% of the entire universe just disappeared. I want to be that 50%. I just want to evaporate. I don’t want to cause any pain or torment to those around me. I just want to vanish from existence without second thoughts. Do I hate myself? No. I just don’t know what to think. I’m not looking for a solution or comfort, I just want to know if people feel this same way? Again, apologies if this is wrong subreddit, but it felt right here.",1
"Can we truly enjoy something, but without realizing it?","What I mean is, 4 years ago I was already depressed, and I thought I was never enjoying anything at all. However now looking back at that time, I see these memories as joyful. I remember enjoying things 4 years ago. I also remember that 4 years ago I thought that I never enjoyed anything.

Maybe with depression we do not fail to enjoy something, but we fail to realize that we are enjoying it?",1
"anyone else miss someone who is never going to come back, and are not sure what to do",I just miss a really close friend so much. Someone who was almost more than a friend because of how much they meant to me. wat do i do :(,1
Idk. Vent/open??,"Hey Reddit, has anyone been at a point to where they’re so tired of life that you look forward to death. I found “spirituality” a few years ago and it held me for a while. Then lost it. 
  Within that I came so close and at ease with the idea of dying. I’ve been depressed since I was 10. I didn’t know I was “depressed” I knew it was a point of sadness I never felt. I lost my grandpa who I dedicated my life to him and lived for him. Within that I tried to “find myself” as a dumb middle school kid I tried being “a man” then started hanging out w the wrong crowd and found “feeling” in doing wrong. To find out that him and my uncle “touched” me. Now I feel like this physical body is useless and kind of disgust me. Then I stuck to just drowning my sorrow away. Then I really started to party to have my moment of fun and then survive the day, then do it all over again. Random meaning less sex w women. Sometimes I’d pass out piss drunk next to dudes doing stuff but I didn’t care bc it’s not like it’s never happened before. That was my introduction to sex. I would drown myself in alcohol, fell in love with acid, Molly, Ecstasy. Went to a really dark place. Hit my all time low.. I’ve tried myself multiple times, I’ve been stabbed it punctured my lung. I tried to slow down the process to the hospital bc it was my chance to leave without doing it myself. The day I woke up in the hospital bed was the worst day of my life… 
 Then I met the most amazing girl. Who knew me better then I knew myself. She knew my whole story and she didn’t care she loved and accept me for it. She gave me a feeling I’ve never felt before. She filled the emptiness I never could, drugs couldn’t fill. She got me sober, I’ve lived my life day by day until I met her. Her love is the only thing that ever gave me hope, we started planning a beautiful future! I felt like she gave that 10 year old kid something to live for! She was my reason! Then on April 23 2022 we got in a car accident. Here i am with a little scratch on my back, my baby is gone and the other driver lost mobility on one side of body from what I hear. 
  My life has been fucking hell and we spent a beautiful time together but I feel like the part of my life when I had her  was a dream bc I’m used to hell. I am tired of this physical life. I’m tired of the same emotions everyday. I’m tired of waking up and putting on a mask. I have a lot of friends and people love to party w me.. but that’s not really who I am. 
 I never saw myself past the age of 18. I am currently 24. I know my soul is amazing but as far as “Zack” idk who tf that guy is. I’m tired of living for other people. I’m still thinking about the little 10 year old kid. I wish I could tell him things got better but they never do. I’ve been fighting 14 years. I think I am ready to come over to the other side. I just feel so unattached from “myself”

There is a lot more idk I just had to vent somewhere",1
I'm 23 this year and I'm completely broken,"I've poured the last 6 years into a relationship I'm no longer in. I have no friends, nobody to talk to or turn to. I sleep in a car because I've lost the house that I used to live in, I'm deep in bank overdraft because I drank to make myself feel better and I'm just completely lost. I've had to give up my best friend my dog because I have nowhere to keep him, he was my rock. I'm just so lost, I have nothing left and don't see a way of moving forward anymore. I just want it all to stop, I can't take it and its all just building up inside My head because I have nobody to talk to about any of it",1
Life sucks,"I am a 17 y/o girl that just wants to die, I am alway feeling suicidal. No one cares about me, I always lose my friends. I am useless",1
my life sucks and i don’t want to be alive anymore,i am just so ready to be done and give up. i don’t want want to alive anymore. everything is so painful and i can’t pay any of my bills and my job sucks and i feel so stuck. everything is just so bad and i hate my life. i don’t think things are ever going to get better. i’ve been cutting so bad and it’s all i think about all the time. every day. i am literally sitting at my desk right now just wanting to die and go home to cut. i hate it. i hate everything and i feel so alone and no one seems to understand. i can’t talk to my parents because they just tell me to be grateful and i try to but everything sucks so much. i can’t even afford food or my meds and the guy i was seeing and close friends with ghosted me and i don’t know why. but i just want to die and life is too painful…..,1
I'm so sad because of loneliness.,"Life was better in high school. Now I'm a 20 year old male, and literally I commute to college, and my college is a commuter school, and I'm so depressed cause I don't connect with anyone. Everyone is just too busy in their own lives to vibe. Everyone treats school like a 9 to 5 job, like they get in and get out when classes are over. Clubs and extracurriculars are hard to participate in because I literally live an hour away. I have no friends or partners, or anyone to share any connection with.",1
nobody cares,"I'm losing faith in friendship and family, only person in my family who cared enough to say supportive things was my mom.


AND THEN YOU ASK ME WHY I WANT TO BECOME A NARCISIST, ITS NOT MY FAULT, I HAVE TO SO I CAN SURVIVE, STOP GIVING ME FALSE HOPES BY SAYING PEOPLE CARE, NOBODY, EVERYBODY MOCKED ME DUE TO MY SEVERE DEPRESSION, BUT THEY LOVED ME WHEN I WAS IN MY BEST STATE , I CAN'T FORGIVE THEM, I HAVE TO TURN INTO A MONSTER AND THEN LEARN TO CONTROL IT

F*CK EVERYONE",1
Im even more depressed now that I’ve lost my bff,"My dog died this morning at 13 years old in her sleep  I’m on vacation rn and she was staying with a family member I’m not looking forward to going back to my house with no dog to greet me and her not being there to fetch toys to feed to go on walks with and etc..  as I get home I’m going to miss her so much and can not stop crying about it my only friend my best friend is gone and tbh I feel like it’s partially my fault I could tell she was acting off and then we’ll she died not soon later..

 my parents told me I can start looking for another dog and as I do want one I feel as if it’s to soon and not honoring my dogs memory I’ll love u forever sweet girl rest well up there ❤️🕊",1
Am I depressed,"Hi, I'm 16 and going on 17, and my entire life, I've been pretty spoiled by my parents and been babied by my mom. I'm very grateful for having what I have. my dad makes good money, I have a stay-at-home mom, and my life has been really, really easy. I have had no traumatizing moments, nothing really bad has happened to me other than getting heartbroken, but that happens to everyone. Idk how to describe it, especially with the life I have, but for a little now, I've been feeling really empty, almost meaningless, I feel like nothing matters, and everything I do is just nothing. There is absolutely nothing going on in my life. I spend my days in my room on my PC doing nothing. When I'm supposed to be doing homework, I watch youtube or play video games with my friends. I've lost so much motivation to do things it's crazy. The only real thing I'm good at is combat sports like boxing and wrestling, and I've completely lost my motivation and interest in training. I love those sports too. I'm currently going through kinda a kind of heartbreak right now which makes me pretty sad, but I've been feeling like this before that, the feeling did stop when I was talking to that girl, I still am, but only as friends; she told me she lost feeling, we were never dating or anything, but I still think about her a lot, and the weird thing is we only have known each other for like almost two months, but I guess it is what is even tho I wish it weren't. Anyways I've lost so much of my motivation to do anything other than watching stupid videos and playing useless video games. My relationship with my mom has been kinda weird, I'm not doing good in school and she gets really mad and disappointed at me for that, and we get into a lot of fights over it, and i know I'm in the wrong but i just can help but thinking shes the bad guy when we argue about me not doing what I'm supposed to do. Recently I've noticed a lot of things get under my skin, like little things like just looking at people, even looking at my family members get me so annoyed, the way people talk, bad jokes people make, the way people do things, people who talk about mental illness, people who talk about politics, and there's so much more if im being honest I've been really mean to my family members for no reason, I've been just such a dickhead and the only people im cool with is my friends who I feel like I just annoy sometimes. My mom doesn't let me go out with my friends because of my grades and i understand that. I feel hopeless with girls at my school, im not very attractive, im only 5'4, im kinda skinny but not like nasty skinny, my face isn't bad but it isn't that good either, I'm pretty funny, at least i think I am, i have really nice hair tho so that's something (its really curry, puffy and it's like a burgundy color). I feel pretty lonely too and im confused about that because, i have a loving family, a good amount of real friends (a good amount of them are just school friends and i wouldn't wanna hang out with them outside of school) but yeah idk how i feel lonely, i just do i didn't really feel lonely when i was talking to that girl but i still shouldn't feel lonely. I really don't have anyone to talk to, like no one knows i feel this way, i kinda put on a face that im really happy and cool when im with my friends (actually i feel pretty happy when im with my friends) but when im home i do kinda put on a fake smile. But yeah i don't talk to anyone about my feeling and don't plan too, I've always felt like it was cringy to do that, especially as a guy, i know that's a bad mindset to have but i do think that way. I really wish I had a girl in my life, i feel like that would fix a lot of things. These bad thoughts come in when im in bed at night, it will sometimes come during the day but mainly at night, i just feel like everyone that i know, kinda has a better life than me, they have jobs, they go out, they talk to girls, their dreams that they can actually accomplish, and i have nothing like that, nothing going on, im about to be a senior in high school and have no idea what i wanna be, i have kinda bad grades, im not looking forward to summer because if i don't get my grades up my mom will take all my stuff away so ill just be in my room doing nothing. I don't look forward to anything, i don't look forward to going to school or home, i don't look forward to training or sleeping, or even waking up, i look forward to nothing. Idk if im just being a spoiled little brat or something like that because i feel like i shouldn't be feeling this way (i don't drink or do drugs btw) but yeah i feel like i should be the happiest guy ever, but i just have been feeling so empty and alone and meaningless. I was doing some research on depression for an essay i have and i was hearing the symptoms and i kinda show the symptoms of it, i laugh it off and told myself i don't have depression cause i don't feel depressed, but again i do that with a lot of my feeling, i just ignore them and tell myself im being stupid and just pushing it to act like im sad, like when i start to cry over my feeling i just force myself to stop and tell myself to stop being such a pussy (My sleep schedule is pretty bad btw). But yeah i kinda show some of these symptoms but i dont feel like im depressed, idk how to feel about all this and just wanted to ask you guys why im feeling all this. My feeling has gotten worse since the girl and i became just friends but i still felt this way before. Idk if its just me growing up or something but yeah just wanted some advice or anything. (Sorry if my grammar and spelling is all messed up don't feel like fixing it)",1
THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21339

 - https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/showthread.php?209740-Brain-working-recursive-Therapy

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

- https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2057


(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”



…Thoughts??",1
My depression is hurting my family,"My family is at their limit with me. I've tried therapy for two years and it hasn't helped. I'm on my second medication but I don't think it'll work. After I told my mom  that I don't have high hopes for the meds, she snapped and said that she can't take it anymore. I'm soulless vaccum that sucks anything positive and brings others down. I never wanted that. My problems are my problems and others shouldn't have to deal with it. My dad even told me once that when ever we talk he feels more depressed. If I'm bringing others down, then what hope do I have of getting better and finally being in a relationship.",1
I really need to talk to someone I don’t know,I doesn’t feel right talking to friends or family. It’s hard. Life is really not good right now. I need to vent,1
I feel low,Everyday when I wake up I feel like I'm never good enough when someone has a bad day I blame it on me I started having suicidal thoughts thinking that if i end it all nobody would care my death would be like any other death sad music people crying and stuff and then as soon as its over everyone lives their lives as I watch from a distance,1
just caught,"My fiance just found out I have been harming myself and flipped out. He knows I struggle with severe depression, but I  hid my SI behaviors from him. I have two ill parents who I take care of (one with dementia and type II diabetes the other with heart issues and diabetes as well). I've been feeling really terrible because it seems like I can't do enough. I tried to tell my fiance that I couldn't make it somewhere important to him, and he said I was being selfish  because I made it all about me. This sent me over the edge and I couldn't take the emotional pain, so I engaged in SI. He then saw it later that night and gave me an ultimatum of me getting before our wedding or he won't marry me. I feel like an awful person and I just lost the only good thing in my life.

Thank you for letting me vent.",1
I just want to wake up tomorrow and not be such a loser.,"I'm a 42 years old. I've never achieved anything of significance in my life. I've never been married or been in a serious, lasting relationship. I haven't been able to attract the attention of a woman in nearly a decade. I have no children. I barely have a college education. Anyone could do the job I do. I earn just enough to meagerly scrape by. Oh, and I'm a recovering alcoholic, though I am presently sober. How do you undo a lifetime of screwing up and hating yourself for it? I just don't want to be who I am anymore. There's only one way around that, though, and it's awfully final. F**k it. I think it's time to put this plan into action. Thanks for reading.",1
All the things I've missed out on," I've wasted my 20's, and now have nothing to show for it. Perhaps I could endure this feeling if I had a more exciting job or a livable wage, but as of rn, the loneliness is killing me and I just want my 1st relationship. The worst part for me is knowing that I'll never get to have those cute, young-person dates like to Disney World or just putt-putt. Those are things other people get to experience and enjoy, but not me. Now, if I ever want to have any relationship at all, I probably have to tie down the 1st person I can find regardless of my attraction to them, their personal health, or even if they have kids. The thing is, I don't want my 1st learning experience to be with some old person like myself. I want to progress normally in my dating experiences and knowledge, but I lost my youth because of how much of a fucking loser I am, that I'll now never be able to know what its like. And I don't want to hear about how ""relationships aren't all fun and roses"" or ""you have more than 1 more chance, don't be dramatic"" bullshit. I don't need to be patronized or talked down to like that rn, and it would be nice if I could learn these lessons on my own, but the fact is, 0 relationships in 30 years, going down that same rate, yeah, I realistically only have 1 more chance in my life, if even that.",1
Very stressed out.,"Things have not been good lately. People are shit. The world is shit. Living is shit. I am shit. Everything is going to hell around me and there’s nothing I can do. 

I can’t keep a stable relationship of any kind. I can’t keep a job if I wanted. I can’t do anything to help lessen the stressors my family is going through. It’s so much stress that my cycle skipped this month. There’s no hope in anything.

It’s so hard. I cut almost everyday now because it’s so fucking hard. There’s nothing I can do that’s if actual importance. So much ruminating,so much stress,so much depression,but no hope.",1
Heya,"Right back where I started, pushing away my loved ones, my girlfriend. I'm stuck in a bar, drinking with strangers thinking about how I don't want to die just want to stay alive for things to get better.

I've been strong for too long,"Imma leave this note here cuz I have no one to leave behind a word for. Mom passed away when I was 6 years old, Papa's an alcoholic, every night he comes home and starts beating me up, He doesn't fund my studies and the only person I trusted in this world, my girlfriend has cheated on me. 
     I can't describe in words how i felt after she said that I don't mean shit to her. Guess that's my destiny, I payed for my college bills alone, fought to get a better life, Sought out help from people but nothing worked. THIS WORLD IS A CURSE THAT WE LIVE IN. I tried to run away from my home, Papa locked me up in my room and was left to starve for 6days no water no food, I sewer tap water when I was thirsty, i cried for help from the window but no one came. 

What was my fault ? Is it me who is at fault for being born into this world ? 

I've been strong for too long now, it's about time i make my own peace.

It is time to rest myself. Goodbye ❤️",1
"50, and just want a dad","I was given away for adoption on the day I was born. I was adopted by a nice couple, I get on well with my new dad and not so much with my mom who is very negative. My adopted dad 25 years ago next month. I’ve never met my real dad, I suspect he may not even know I exist. My birth mom hadn’t really got time for me. I am lucky to have my kids, a great partner and friends. And I know these relationships should be enough. But all I want is my dad. Memories keep flooding back, sadness is how I start most days and I just don’t feel like doing anything. I’ve spoken to a great councillor last year. But they can’t give me what I need.",1
Exhausted,"We just moved to a new place, again. My anxiety, depression, and self loathing has reached new levels so bad it’s scaring me. I hate myself. I disgust myself. I’ve let myself go. I have kids I’m trying to do right by every single day, and frankly they are my reason for life. I JUST want to be happy. I JUST want to be okay. I feel like I’ve been screaming out for help and no one is listening. I feel so alone. I hate it here. I need friends.",1
"""It gets better"" is what they e always said.","But I swear I've only gotten worse. Some days have been better, and sometimes if does look up, but I'm probably the bumpiest of roller coasters if I were to turn my mood chart into one. The only consistent thing is it keeps going lower after every rise.

I'm someone who never really cried. In the last few years, the only reason I've cried has been death. This month, though, it's like my downward feelings after working double time. I've become the person who literally cries to sleep every night. I've actively prayed for my own death. I don't wanna be here anymore, but I don't want to to be my fault because I know how that'll hurt people.

Maybe that's part of why I'm incapable of losing weight? I've always been 300+lbs since my early teens, and I've tried to lose it the whole way between there and here. This year was my most success, I got and stayed under 290 for a couple months. But it teetered back to 310.

I'm 26. The damage done to my body is probably irreversible now, even if I were to lose the weight. Maybe a heart attack will take me?

It feels like my life ended when I was 11 and I'm just here as a formality at this point. No one knows for sure that it gets better. When people say that, I wanna ask them to show me their crystal ball so I can see what they see. I have no expectations anymore.

At this rate, I work to live, and live to work, and there's nothing more to it.",1
good God I am so miserable,"I relapsed to porn yesterday for the first time in a long time. I have an amazing girlfriend who I cherish and have betrayed. She has only ever known sober me -- what I am supposed to do now?

Update on my life a year later,"Addition to a previous post I’ve made

Some of this requires context, some not. My previous post is long winded, but if you feel so inclined you can go view it. I’m not sure what I want out of this, probably just to let it out to anybody 

——————Addition———————

It’s been over a year since I wrote this. Things are better and worse. A has cut me out of her life at this point and I never would’ve said this a year ago, but I’m kinda glad she did. Almost a sort of brutal freedom, I don’t expect to hear or see her again, nor for her to survive the decade with the path she seems hellbent on taking herself down. I have good friends that I laugh and have fun with, but in comparison to what I had with A it all feels so surface level. I try to be my old self, the one who could capture the eyes of anyone in a room and spin the yarn of a tale to make the room laugh uncontrollably, but I feel like that’s fading day after day. Day after day I feel like I’m losing little bits and pieces of what make me…..well me and all my attempts to stop it or build something new are in vein

I’m a good actor, I guess in A’s words being a stoic son-of-a-bitch has it’s perks, I got a standing ovation from the entire school after I got revenge for my dead lover by killing a landlord, I made people in the audience cry even, I had a scene where it was me, a ceramic revolver, the school, and 50 lines of dialogue, of self reflection for me to deliver. I brought the bickering and rowdy crowd of high schoolers to near total silence. They cheered as I spit on the landlord at the end, they egged my character on to kill her, there where audible gasps and a distinct “no!” when my character died at the end. I was good because was imagining myself getting revenge for A, I imagined that the girl who played the landlord (great person off-stage, we’re good friends so this isn’t personal) was the embodiment of everything I hated, everything I regretted, to the point of me even shedding a tear. Which I suppose was the point, to my character she was exactly that. I felt a little part of my old self come back that night, and it felt good 

I’ve picked up learning languages as a hobby almost. I originally started with Spanish to try to impress A, but it spiraled and now I’m the guy at school to ask if you’ve got a bit of most any major European language you need translated (not Spanish there’s plenty of kids at my school who speak flawless Spanish)

Academically I’m good, I’m in the top 10% of my class, my lowest grade is an 87%. All the teachers in the history section of my school know I want to be one when I grow so I get extra tutoring from them to the point of us calling eachother by our first names. My finance teacher and soccer coach is the same.

Everyone says that I should feel proud of myself for it all, but the play is the only thing that I really feel good about. The rest feels 2nd nature to me, not like an accomplishment worthy of pride 
I hate that I view it that way, but I can’t change it 

I’ve tried to move on from A, God knows I’ve tried, but I just can’t and I don’t know why. She moved back and things where good for awhile. We had some arguments and we had a falling out for a few days. She said some very personal things to me, attacks that could be made using only things that she knew, she was the only one who could wield those words as painfully as she did, and she cut deep. Eventually she came back to say sorry, fool I am I accepted. She asked me out eventually, I asked her to prom, we both said yes. 

It seemed like everything I had wanted with this girl for 2 years was finally coming true

Then for reasons I haven’t a slightest clue of, she stopped talking as much, for 3 months we didn’t see eachother and all my attempts to reach out to try and help her where denied. Now she’s said she doesn’t want to talk to me at all. I’m waiting for the day she’ll realize the injustice, but I fear that this outburst is different 

I have a necklace that she gave me, a simple nail fashioned into a sword tied to a string. I’ve worn it as a good luck charm almost, a reminder that I did what i did because without her I might’ve not had the chance. I have no clue what to do with it now, it is my most valued possession, but I want to just throw it on the top shelf of my closet to be forgotten about 

I want be a teacher when I’m done with high school, History or maybe a language. I’m pretty good at Spanish with some French, Italian, and Esperanto under my belt. Beyond that I want to travel the world, take a year or two to just leave everything behind and try to find myself. I’m chasing the high I felt when I finished my monologue, but I doubt I’ll ever feel that rush a adrenaline and dopamine again",1
It keeps creeping back in,Why won't my depression go away I was just feeling better I got some new friends talk to more people or try to but now I'm questioning if they like me at all I'm the only one who ever asks to hang out and they totally stood me and my other friend up today we hung out later anyway but still they said they would hangout but they didn't now my self doubt is coming back are my confidence is leaving. last time I posted it helped a bit just to get shit of my chest felt a little better. also last time their was this girl she talked to me liked me like liked me I had had the same feelings but it didn't lead anywhere.

Struggling,"I’m literally depressed without even realizing. I went thru a lot in life. With the pandemic, getting sexual assaulted, having narcissistic dad and being around him is draining, kept losing friends and having no friends. Switching school and the school refuse let me go in person due to lack of access for me. So I do online classes. I thought it will be worth it but it was one my HELL year I had. My dog was pregnant and had puppies. I had to take care of dogs alone everyday. My grandpa passed away. I had severe obsession with drinks from places and using phone. My mental health is so so bad. I’m not socializing with people and I even don’t like people. I don’t know what to do now because all I feel is weird. I wanted to get better. Im also tired of being mf insecure. Boys kept playing me.",1
My boyfriend is depressed and pushing me away.,"I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) for over two years. We live together and are genuinely best friends. A year ago, my boyfriend decided to go on Lexapro because he experiences what his doctor believed to be “anxiety attacks” once a month, at the same time every month (please also comment if you’ve ever heard of something like this). The “anxiety attacks” have continued, so his doctor wants him to get off the Lexapro and see a psychiatrist to rule out anything going on with his brain because his doctor no longer believes he’s experiencing “anxiety attacks”. The downside is that the Lexapro has a number of known side effects, all of which he has been dealing with the past year since going on them. He never dealt with depression before, but he now admits he wakes up every morning unhappy (but that it gets better throughout the day). He has completely lost his sex drive, which has taken a toll on our relationship. He never *wants* to do anything and instead just does things to either a) make me happy b) make his family happy or c) pass the time. He says he feels guilty because he can’t give me what I “deserve” and that he thinks I would be better off without him. He says he knows he still loves me, but isn’t sure he’s still *in* love with me because he no longer has a desire to kiss, hug or have sex with me and it scares him. 
What do I do? I try to frequently reassure him that I love him and that it’s my turn to take care of him just like he has previously taken care of me. I try my best to be patient and give him space while also coming up with (what I think are) fun ideas to get him out of the house. My gut is telling me it’s just the depression talking and that he needs love and support right now, but there’s also that little insecure voice inside my head saying he’s doing whatever he can to push me away and that he actually doesn’t want to be with me anymore - depression or not.



Edit 1: I should at that he’s struggling with “smiling depression” meaning he appears happy on the outside. His family and friends have no idea, and would have no idea, that this is going on. The only reason I know he’s struggling with depression us because I live with him and he is honest with me about how he’s feeling. 

Edit 2: I want to emphasize that he was struggling with anxiety, not depression, prior to taking Lexapro. I believe his depression is a side effect of the medication. He is currently weaning himself off, which I know can also exacerbate his symptoms. 

Edit 3: For some reason, I keep getting notifications that people have commented on this post, but I can’t see them. If I haven’t responded to you, that’s why. Please send me messages instead of commenting below.",1
Being a short male is making me beyond depressed,"I’m a 20 year old male and I’m 5’9 didn’t believe I’m that short but todays society makes me feel worthless. What really triggered all this was a few months back I started dating a girl who is 5’6. We are still dating. Sometimes she calls me little or small and one time even called me a midget it kills me inside it really does. She really likes me and she’s great but I’ll probably end up dumping her because we are close in height. It seems like she’s playfully joking around but that shit hurts dude. My two older sisters always talk about short men like it’s some sort of disgusting mutation and  how they will only date a guy who’s over 6 feet both of them are under 5’4. I’ve gotten confident worked out gotten a good physique but there’s just no point. Women want tall guys and that’s just not me. It’s on my mind 24/7 and when I say that I mean it. Every person that walks past me I compare height with, when I see a  celebrity on TV and research their height. It makes me so angry that I’ve taken up jiu justsu and MMA because it’s I only thing I get relief from. I can’t do anything like fight or lift without being told I’m compensating for my size. I honestly do feel like I have to compensate because society is like this. Worst part is I can’t even tell anybody about this because nobody will take it seriously and just laugh at me and call me an incel. I guess I’ll just suffer in silence or end up sucking on a gun.",1
Moving the date,"I'm moving the date of my death from the 20th of June to this Thursday. My psychiatrist just prescribed me Lithium, so I can OD on that.",1
I broke up with my gf two days ago and I’m scared,"I’m (16M) in high school, I recently broke up with my girlfriend (16F) on Friday, straight to the point my last straw was when she sent a video of one of her guy friends deadlifting her off the ground, it’s this tik tok trend that your usually supposed to do with your lover not with some douchbag that doesn’t understand boundaries. Yeah, I know it might sound silly and many of you might not understand.

Before that happen, we had an argument, it was about my ex being mad at me about how I couldn’t be there for her in the morning at school cause she feels uncomfortable and embarrassed that her group of friends who kicked her out of the group are always walking around her when they get off the bus and walk into school. I tried to explain I can’t always be there cause I’m tired from a lot of things going on in my life and I had a rough week already. She’s always mad at me whenever I’m going through something and it pisses me off, all we do is argue now and our conversations got dry, I tried to fix things and she will just leave me on open or just still act the same after we make up from a dispute, it’s like she’s acting like a 12 year old and says we need to communicate but then she barely uses any effort. It’s like when it came to that point in our relationship she expects me to carry the relationship and puts the blame on me.

I love how I can’t have female friends buy she can go around sending me videos of the same dude touching her in class, she got mad at me one time cause I was helping one of my female friends get a boyfriend with this one guy in our class and she accused me of talking to her more than I do to her which was not true the only time I ever talked to my friend was in class.

I know our relationship looks bad but In the five months that we dated, felt like we’ve been together for a year. We did a lot of stuff together and we have so many memories, it’s just sad that it was this whole month where it was hard for the both of us, I still don’t know if I was wrong or in the right for my decision. I miss her, and I’m devastated and im scared at night cause I don’t have my best friend anymore. She lost all her friends and all she had left was me and her cousin that lives in another state. I feel like a dhead but I don’t know I want to go back and try to understand and maybe get back together but I don’t know I’m scared of the outcome. 

We texted this morning cause she wanted to ask me something but that isn’t important anymore, and we just ended up ending things better on better terms, when I broke up with her on that day I was cussing her out and I felt really bad afterwards and she doesn’t use language like I do, I apologized. She told me she felt lonely and that I’m still her friend and I’m here for her. I asked if she went back to her toxic friend group cause I thought she did because a friend from that group started talking to her again but apparently she didn’t and then I said okay I’m here for you if they try to bother you again and all she said was “ok”. And we didn’t talk after that.

She archived or deleted some pictures of us on some her socials today, she still follows me on some socials too and we still have communication with each other. It felt good to get this off my chest just by writing about it.",1
Times like this I wish I drank alcohol to make the pain go away,"How do I cope with being ostracized from my team for 4 whole years. Being looked down on. Me and my partner in debate do everything we can, we win tournaments we semi final them we quarter them. We get first and second at locals. But that isn’t enough for our team to not look down at us. We are the only two upcoming seniors in the entire program who aren’t team captains. We got associate captains. What does that even mean? Glorified good for nothing?.. Im done.",1
An unwavering struggle,"I'm currently 28 years old  
I never thought I'd reach this age, or even close to it  
I've been doing okay, most days good even. I've purchased a home with my partner of four years and I've had family recently move to the city I live in.  
But it's a struggle trying to figure out where to go from here.  
As I mentioned, I never thought I'd be alive at this age, let alone any older. So I really don't know what to do. Trying to figure out what I want my future to look like makes me feel ill  
But even continuing to take one day at a time and make decisions as they come scares me because I'm 28 years old but I still don't feel comfortable with living.   
One day I might be 35 years old and still feeling the same way.  
What if I have children and still feel like this?  
I might be able to function daily and outwardly have a seemingly normal life but this is feeling and thoughts are a constant that's never waivered for me.",1
I'm sick and tired of hearing it,"I'm tired of hearing people say ""Oh, but there's so much to live for! People will miss you!"" etc. etc. I'm so sick of existing for other people's benefit at my expense. I just want to die. Let me die in peace.",1
I'm really depressed,"I feel really lost. I'm 32 and still I don't think anything is stable in my life, specially the financial stability is a big deal for me. I'm planning to persue my education with a PhD but I'm not doing enough. I don't have enough energy. My phone is full of unread messages and I usually leave people unread. Because I can't stand having a converstation with friends which usually starts with what are you doing? How's the applications going? I don't have a good answer and it only reminds me of the time I'm killing and how I'm making myself miserable. I used to go to therapy and I've tried different therapists. I just want to be active and have a normal and productive life. I'm not satisfied with myself and it's killing me.",1
I want to die but I don’t want to let my family down,"Last night I went to a wedding, everyone (seemed) to be happy.  I faked it all.

Behind in school.,"Hello, I’m 13 female and I am really behind in school. (Btw im homeschooled) Basically, with homeschooling its at your own pace and you dont have deadlines or anything like that. I was doing good at the very start of the year but now im extremely behind and I dont know why I just hate school so much. I left public school because of my anxiety / depression and I dont think im quite ready to go back yet. I also considered online school but I know I would definitely not like it either. Im not failing but I don’t remember the last time I actually did my work. My parents are really nice and they know my situation so they aren’t hard on me to do work but they obviously care about my education. Also, I dont know if it’s depression or because I got used to not doing my work early on. Im getting better and I feel way happier nowadays so Im just confused on what to do with school :/ please help, thanks!!",1
I feel like a loser,"I'm 22 years old and I don't have a job, that makes me feel so terrible because my mom gives me money and I feel bad for spending her money. I've tried almost everything to get some cash but it's not working. I've tried to have my own business but they fail or they aren't affordable. I submitted my resume to several jobs but they just ""call me later"" (obviously, they never call). I even tried to get money by ""selling content"" (like nudes and hot calls) but I didn't get enough money and it made me feel ashamed. 

I  have a lot of problems at home so now I'm renting in another state because of college but it's more expensive than staying at home. But if I stay at home  my stress level will just increase and I'll feel worst.

By the way I've been coping with anxiety and depression since I was 15. I used to do self harm but I tried to be sober (it's been like 10, months or maybe a year since I last self harmed). I've been seeking like 5 therapist but now I'm tired and I don't want to have therapy anymore. Even though I had some progress, I feel like it's useless and it's always the same shit.

So I replaced self harm with another things like alcohol, marijuana and medicine. Don't worry, I don't do this often, just when I feel very bad  I tend to drink or get a little high. Unfortunately, this made me take bad decisions, like stealing my grandma's Clonazepam and taking the whole bottle. She doesn't know but now she need it and I feel so bad for it.

Sometimes I feel like I need to be intoxicated to forget about my problems and if I can't get intoxicated I just replace that with physical pleasure like having a lot of sex or masturbating just to feel relaxed.

By the way my social life is a mess. I don't have any friends at college, and my only three friends are miles away and they barely talk to me so I feel so fucking lonely. I have a boyfriend but I don't want to depend on him but I feel like I'm already codependent because he's the one who's always there for me and if he's not I feel sad.

Conclusion : I'm a broke ass alcoholic drug addict and codependent loser.",1

Anyone else really hate when you “run out of sleep”,My favorite activity is sleeping. But when I’ve finally used up all my tiredness I end up even more depressed.

Not gonna lie my depression lowkey winning (19yro m),"(Sorry for the shitty grammar I'm not to good at typing or even talking for that matter)

So a little while ago my older brother died. But before his death I was pretty depressed to begin with because of my life at home and at school. But when I was in school I could at least tolerate the pain. But I don't know why but loosing my brother just made my soul in literally just stop. Like I literally am unable to tell who the person that currently resides in this body is. Literally just a husk of the person I was before. Like I literally have stopped doing everything I've enjoyed because they no longer entertain me and  I've just become completely too lazy to do them. And in top of that I've been soo tired and drained to a point to where I've literally haven't gotten mad or sad about it anymore. Honestly man I just don't know what the fuck to do anymore I mean it's so bad that I've literally just stop speaking to my friends. God I hate this.

So there's that for anyone that cares",1
I feel like I'm invisible,"I feel like I'm invisible. Nobody notices me. Everything I do is taken for granted. I pour my heart and soul into things and nobody cares, if they even notice it at all. My music for example. Both solo work and with my band, on the off hand people listen, it's all just a joke to them. Nobody genuinely likes it, even though it means everything to me. I try to do things for other people, and it's just entirely taken for granted. I feel so pathetic, nobody actually gives a crap about me, I'm so tired of it. 

Sorry this is incoherent, I'm just tired of being a nobody with one real friend (who I've never actually met).",1
I'm living my phobia,"I've dealt with major depression since I was eight. I was hospitalized in eight grade and then upon release put straight into out patient care for three months until I was deemed well enough to return to school and such. In the out patient care we did a lot of therapy and group activities specific to whatever we were dealing with. 

One of our group sessions sticks out to me to this day. I was 13 when I attended this and I'm now 20. The group was about our phobias and fears. We would write a list and then as a group talk and decide what fears were ""rational"" and which were ""irrational"" 

I had a single fear written down. And it's something I struggled with since my brother's sudden passing. I still have graphic, vivid nightmares of it. My single phobia is ending up alone. No friends. No family. Living and dying alone. 

I was told that was irrational. A sentiment I didn't believe at the time and for rightful reasons. At the age of only 20. I have ended up mostly alone. The only person I talk to, hang out with, do anything personal with, is my boyfriend. 

My mom has been ignoring me for weeks now. I've been in and out of the ER due to severe health concerns. The only person that's been there with me through it is my boyfriend. I've tried so often to call my mom. I tried so much to reach out since she always told me she'd be there when I need her. Yet here I am, sobbing. In pain. Alone. 

I'm living my worst fear and I'm not coping well. I'm drowning. I just had a break down, screamed and sobbed so loud my throat is raw. My apartment is so quiet and I'm so devastated. 

I've tried making friends but I'm horrible at staying connected. I always feel like an annoyance trying to hang out. Everytime I do I get brushed off since everyone I know has other things. I have one person in my life that actually tries. But that's such a shitty hand to be dealt. Having a partner so shattered and isolated. I don't know why he stays. I'm waiting for when he says it's too much. 

I know it's coming. And I get it. He deserves someone that's whole. 

I just wish this nightmare of an existence would end already. I hate feeling so alone.",1

it’s not worth it anymore,"since i last posted about my situation, i’ve genuinely tried to improve my life. i’ve started exercising, cutting back on alcohol, and trying to do things i enjoy. i still haven’t been able to find stable work, although i have had a few odd jobs here and there to help keep a bit of money come in, it’s not enough still. i  even went to see a couple of my favourite bands recently too. i’ve been trying to be productive, today i worked and changed the oil on my vehicle (no i don’t take it to get done, everyone should know how to change oil). now i’m sitting in my driveway having a drink after cleaning up. but not mater what i do, hobbies, work, events, etc. nothing has really changed. people i try to engage with end up leaving or ignoring me. nothing i do has any lasting effect to make the way i feel change or go away. i can’t count on people to be there for me. im cursed with this never ending darkness and it touches everything in my horrid life. i think people can tell that something is wrong but no cares enough to do anything. if people don’t think that i’m worth the time or effort to stick around for, i don’t think i will stick around any longer than i have to. i’m too tired of feeling like this, it’s been over 20 years. as i said in my last post: i’ll wait it out till the end of the year, but i don’t think i’m going to last that long. it’s not worth it anymore. i don’t know when ill let death’s calm embrace take me to whatever lies after, but i hope it’s soon. 🍻 to death",1
company,"18M here i feel genuinely scared for what's about to happen in the near future, i've been suffering alot since the death of my grandmother which was like 8 years ago. i haven't been attending school lately because i have no initiative and don't see the point going to school because i don't know what to do and at the same time i'm afraid i won't graduate, will i graduate with the remaining two weeks? i want to graduate but i'm too scared to attend and people would shame me. me and my family don't talk much and my brothers have their own lives. i was super extroverted during high school and because of covid i isolated in my room and became more aware of the illnesses that i have. i'm diagnosed with bipolar depression and my anxiety couldn't handle talking to people i don't talk much to my friends anymore, is it because of me? is it  because i changed for the worse? or do they not care about me and moved on with their lives? am i that worthless of a person that they don't care about me anymore? i'm sorry if this offends anyone but i'm the type of person who would laugh at people using reddit cause the website can't be trusted but here i am crying my eyes out typing this. the way i've been typing this has been very messy i wanted to erase it all again but idc anymore xd, i was in a online relationship during covid we ended things last year november, i have to say she was the best thing that happened to me she made me feel safe feel loved made me feel special and made me feel heard, as soon as it goes things get messy and i started to depend on her disresgarding her feelings it became like i was obsessed with her cause i wouldn't understand why she wouldn't reply to me in a couple minutes, she talked abt that issue with me multiple times but i still wouldn't listen that i'm the only one for her, we were on and off because of how messy it got it wasn't toxic we didn't cuss each other out it was just really messy, different schedules and different lives and different places. now that we're not together i still miss her and i talk to her from time to time catch up and hope for the best to each other. there's a tiny person inside me who wants to be with her again but i won't hold on to it. this may not reach to anyone but i feel much better now and i stopped crying just now i'm so happy i got to type this out i feel so relieved.",1

It’s getting worse,"It’s getting worse and I don’t know what to do anymore. I kind of always felt like this but it was like white noise in the background- I had gotten used to it. And now it’s all coming back. Worse than it usually is, or maybe it’s not worse I just had forgotten what it felt like for sometime. And I’m pushing my friends away, I’m pushing my family away. I’m back into an endless cycle of wanting to burst into tears all day long. I’m back to having silent mental breakdowns 5 times in my room. And honestly this all used to happen before also. It never went away, just because I was distracted for a few weeks I forgot about it. I got my hopes up thinking maybe this is going away. Maybe I’m becoming normal and maybe I’ll be a happier person now. I was wrong. It wasn’t getting better. And now- I just hate it. I have feeling this way. I have no reason to be like this. My life seems great. And I can’t even appreciate that. Sometimes I really think there’s something fundamentally wrong with me and I can’t even do anything about it. And I wish I could.

On the edge," I'm 28 and have managed to suffer emotionally and at the brink of economic destruction in the first 10 years of my adult life.

At age 18 I got into college in the first few months I got involved playing poker ,beginners luck made me a good sum of money which soon after lost due to gambling,drinking and also had a terrible car crash.As a result I dropped out of college  and left to Santorini to work as a waiter. I was making minimum  wage met a girl and moved in with her ,I spent all my money on holidays and renting a house with her.Our relationship became a mess as whatever I did for her wasn't enough ,soon after see dumped me and hooked up with my best friend behind my back.

At age 21 I was an emotional  mess but with a better job,however I used all my money having drugs ,going out and having multiple sexual relationships  in order to fill the emptiness.Within  2 years I managed to hurt many close friends,crashed my car twice and lost all my money.

With my last 200 euros I invested in bitcoin making 20k in return ,however for some reason I lied to everyone that I made more.At the same time at age 24 I got in a relationship with a girl that had a bad reputation ,we decided to make a fresh start , stop having drugs,going out and got serious by collecting money and being just me and her against the world. I tried to make a business  with a friend of mine but I didn't have enough  money to get in because I lied,also I figured out he was trying to con me, which resulted in getting sued,I dealt with the mess but all this stress destroyed my relationship.Our fights were never ending,I used to treat her bad and so did she.Soon after I realised she was only with me because I was offering a home and was paying most of her expenses.When I borrowed her money to buy a car a few months later she left me got close to some friends I had ,turned all of them against me and hooked up with most of them.

I was 26 devastated,alone,with most of my money spent.I started to see a psychiatrist, I started  feeling better, 3 months later I met a beautiful  girl with a good job and values,in the beginning  I still wasn't over my ex ,she got involved  in our relationship causing trouble.I didn't put boundaries  and starting losing respect from my new relationship .At that point I decided to turn things around and fix my new relationship,I felt she was the one. In the same time my mandatory military service time was due,I had to go to the army for 9 months.This brought huge amount  of stress on my relationship,which caused a break up. Near the end of my service I decided  to start a restaurant business. I borrowed money from my parents,I convinced them I had enough money to make it.However I mis calculated the costs.I got back together with my girlfriend.While we were together I was spending money I couldn't afford to lose , I brought stress on her because I couldnt finish my business ,she hadn't also forgiven me for my past mistakes and also I had abusive outbreaks.

 A month ago she left me ,my parents have spent all their money,I have spent all my money and got a loan,people depend on me to start work in my business.Now in the next 10 days I have to borrow a big sum of money,otherwise I will lose my business, all my employees and won't be able to give money I owe. I feel I'm on the edge ,all my adult life I have been making wrong decisions causing trouble to me and to those around me. I'm on the edge ,I realise my mistakes but it's too late.",1
I’m at a loss,"People always say that you can’t give up if you really want something. Other people will say that you have to know when to give up and I can’t seem to do either. 

I keep thinking, “maybe if I keep showing interest or change myself or do something, maybe she’ll leave her boyfriend” even though, realistically, this could be a worse outcome. I keep picking apart our past conversations looking for signs that I wasn’t being delusional. That maybe there was something there. I keep looking for any type of sign saying that I should keep fighting and I keep thinking that I see a sign or two but that might just be delusion. 

On the other hand, I know I’ve already lost and I should just move on. She has a boyfriend and she’s not the type to just leave someone for no reason. Plus, she’s moving so there’s a chance that I’ll never see her again. I keep telling myself that I don’t need her. My life isn’t a fairytale, it’s not like my problems would be cleanly solved just like that. I want to use the knowledge and experience that I gained from our interactions and just move on.",1

I had some of the craziest dreams and I learned about my actual mental state from this…,"This post I very long but the thing is, I have been thinking about this for the past year now wondering lots of things about me, like who I am or what my place is or could be in this excuse of a world I built for my self or worse of all:
What is wrong with me?

I often heard that dreams are like your brain’s message to you or something along the lines of that. These were dreams I had around 2-3 months ago. Where I truly realized that I cracked and that I’m too broken to be fixed quickly. 
The first dream was me walking in an empty and dark abyss, I was walking for what seemed like hours until I heard a voice which sounded like a mix of Freddy Kruger and Venom saying “ You’re here! I was actually beginning to think that it wouldn’t work but you’re hear!” And then I was chained up by the wrist and ankles and of course I question what the fuck is happening and then they play The Mandarin’s intro from Iron Man 3 but only the part where he said to consider him a teacher and me the student and that here’s my first lesson: Then this dream thing says “You want death but you’re not willing to accept it and go through with it, you just want your life to be easy.”
I question how much he knows about me and he just laughs it off and says “ KNOW YOU!(He lets out a joker laugh and says) I PRACTICALLY RAISED YOU!” And my sarcastic ass decides to say “a simple yes would’ve sufficed”
And then he drops me while saying “you’ll learn soon and if you don’t, that’s on you.” I hit my leg (coincidentally the one I sprained today, my left) and I wake up with a bruise on my leg I don’t think much of the dream until I get more dreams which I’m going to sum up.

We talk and he points out my flaws and tells me I can do better without telling me HOW to do better and then he brought me outside my house, and I see my grandpa who has been dead for almost a year, and I’m walking with him, enjoying the time I had and then he(grandpa) tells me in Spanish “dile a lila que la amo mucho” (In English:tell lila, a nickname he had for my mom, that I(my grandpa)love her a lot) and then he vanished and I almost start crying, and then the dream guy says “you… you disgust me” all I can see is a red line for an eye and a venom eye(from the movie)That’s interesting, you show more emotion to the dream-death of your own grandfather then the actual day you found out he died,”. And then I wake up only to repeat the cycle, but he does in a way ti describe my love life(if you could even call it that) through this school year, making me realize why I don’t get crushes or fall in love with people, it’s because I hate myself to such an extent that I can’t bear to think that someone genuinely likes/loves me and I make all these self-deprecating jokes and pop-culture jokes to comfort my own brain from having a second mental breakdown.

Then one day I think it was the April 2-6 where I saw him and he said he was proud of me and revealed himself to me, and he was.. me! But a horrifically disfigured me with parts of my body missing and damaged. And then he says “You’ll have a friend who you start to develop a crush on but then realize that she isn’t what you thought she was I’m warning you, help yourself from turning into me” and immediately after I said that, I woke up.
And I was right, the girl is the horniest person I know and am glad I stopped liking her, if anything I realize how annoyingly horny she is! A girl I liked and had lots of thing in common with just went POOF I opened my eyes and saw who she really is.
I recently saw dream me again and this time there was a vinyl record player playing distorted versions of “It’s a burning memory” and later “Man without love” and we just talked and he said that I was making slow progress since he was less hole-y, less bloody, and had one proper eye. I was fixing my future but I still have a long journey ahead of me.


I was lectured about my depression and myself by myself damn. Sorry that this was long and felt cheesy at times and I hope you have a good day or night.",1
can’t remember much,"I have been numb for years and can’t remember much. My mind has just completely shut down. My feelings, thoughts, actions…everything is just nothing. Idk what I’m saying haha",1
I don’t even believe in this kind of stuff but I actually think I am cursed.,"2022 has been the worst year of my life. At the start of the year my grandmother passed away in hospital (died partly due to hospital negligence). This broke my heart. I told a customer about it at work and he said he had the a similar thing happen and he also said “bad stuff happens in threes”, his mother died, his wife left him and his family dog died. I thought nothing of that. Until now.

Today I said goodbye to my best friend/dog. He was with me for over a decade. It was bad enough loosing my family member earlier in the year I am still grieving from that but now I have this added sadness too. That, is bad thing number 2. Just hours after visiting the vets with my dog my other grandmother calls to say she doesn’t want to worry us but she feels extremely sick. She’s been on and off sick for months at one point in the same hospital at the same time as my late grandmother. We have just visited her and she is awfully ill. We have had to take her to hospital. I can’t help but shake the feeling that this is bad thing number 3. I honestly can’t take anymore sadness and loss. I know it’s not true but it feels like the world is ending, everything is spiralling out of control.",1
I feel empty,"I try so hard to be happy but I feel burnt out. I dont know what to do with myself. Right now, im in university and I like what im studying but I feel no motivation to keep trying. All I want to do is sleep. I keep looking for the next thing to distract me, a game, a TV show, a social outing. But once im left alone with my thoughts, I feel empty and I dont know what to do with myself. I feel misunderstood but also the most basic, predictable person at the same time. Im content to call myself a bitch, a loser and good for nothing but whenever anyone else affirms those beliefs it feels profound and I can't take it. Im looping everyday through the same motions. Ive stopped taking care of myself, I eat whatever I want, I need to go to the doctors because I have a rash that has not gone away, I have to be allergic to something but I dont know what it is, ive chipped my tooth and I need to go to the dentist, I've tried three times to start therapy- I get the papers but I never attend more than a few sessions or even call to book in. 

Why is everything so difficult?",1
"I am terrified of being a nuisance, a burden.","I want to bring good into the world. At the very least, I want to be a neutral presence, taking up almost no space, imposing myself upon no one. I wish I weren't this person. There are so many wonderful people around me who deserve their places in this world. I should not be here.",1
I help everyone and no one helps me,I help folks and folks don't help me. In irl and online. I feel alone scared and trapped like there's no tomorrow matter of fact I believe there won't be I try to be positive but I honestly can't anymore the world is depressing and so are the people in it,1
Eh…,I’ve been really actively doing stuff for my plan. Yesterday I got one of the ekhm magic ingredients ekhm and it feels so weird… It’s something I need anyways but now that I know what potential it has it feels so strange. I’m still at a stage of grieving my life kind of. It’s so many strange feelings.,1
Does anyone ever care about anyone but themselves?,"I hate myself and I feel there must be something wrong with me. I have no friends. How am I suppose to think there is nothing wrong when no one wants to talk to me or wants anything to do with me?

I don't think I'm ugly, I try to be in shape, I'm an artist and I love to learn, but people act like they can't stand me. I try to be nice and kind to everyone. I work hard. I mean I'm a bit of an introvert and I have trouble when it comes to talking to people but I'm not mean or disrespectful. 

Friends constantly leave and don't tell me what they are doing and don't invite me, and not just one group of friends but several have done this over my lifetime. Girls say hurtful things to me when I'm not even trying to flirt and I want nothing but friendship. 

I just end up alone and hurt all the time. It's dark and I hate myself because something has to be wrong with me. I mean I should just kill myself and rid the world of me if nobody's going to notice then why take up the space. 

Give my stuff to the people that need it. It's just wasted on me.

I've failed at everything. I've failed to fall in love, I've failed to make friends, I've failed to get a decent job, I've failed to do anything with my life. I will probably fail at ending it. I just suck! 

I mean I've reached out to so many people. I've tried so very hard to find just one cute girl to love me and then I've tried to find just one person, any person to love me. I'm tired. So very tired. God. I wish I could've severed you better. Hate and pain fill me. 

Floating away on a river of pain. 
Surrounded by plants watered by deathly rain. 

This ecosystem of life carries my heart away
As I sit and listen to the beating of my soul fighting to stay.

How do we know right from wrong when we've written the rules we've known for so long.

How do we judge those who make mistakes
when we know the cost of the imprint it makes

Its time to change the old ways of mankind
Before we destroy what little love there is to find. 

Cast away your fear, doubt, and hate.
Emrace the golden rule before its too late.",1
I wrote a new post about my fight with depression.,"i have just won my fight against depression I feel much better. it was a long road. a few years ago i saw a sort of French film about a person that wanted to show others what is like living with depression. he draws the depression as a dragon that stops him to do stuff that he wants to do. (is anybody here saw that and can send me a link? bc I can't find that) . Anyway, what stuck with me was the idea that depression is like that monster. every time I had bad thoughts about myself or had suicidal needs I felt the tail of the dragon around my neck squeezing me. after the last therapy that I have been through, I am feeling that the dragon went away. I don't know if it will come back or not but for now, I am feeling good and enjoying every minute of that. so for the post. i wrote posts that maybe will help some of you with your fight. it is full of advice from my own experience. don't be shy to write comments and fix me if need be bc it is your fight too and maybe you can send me advice too.

Just Need Some Help & Advice,"Just some background information: I’m an 18 y/o incoming D1 athlete in football and I’m suffering so much from whatever I have. I am an extremely competitive person who does everything I love with passion and the fullest intent. If you’re reading this and have a negative stigma on football players, please just understand and give my story a chance. Also if you are an athlete and see this, please just give me some feedback or advice. It could change my life, seriously. 

Although life seems like it could be great, it is currently just the opposite. One of the toughest things that I’ve been dealing is accepting the outcome that COVID & transfer portal. had on my recruitment. I had multiple FBS offers (higher level football), but could not commit to them due to transfers and extra-year seniors taking my “spot.” I signed my NLI (binding contract) to an FCS school and paid my deposit to enter the school. Well, this is the worst thing that has happened to me. I’ve been dealing with this pain from not going FBS and cannot take the pain, guilt, and acceptance of not going to where I want to be. Sometimes I question on why all of this happened and what could I have done to make my situation better. The truth is that there wasn’t anything different I could’ve done differently. Although it sounds cliché, it is just the truth. The college I’m going to has not produce any NFL talent (my dream) and it feels like I just won’t be able to make it. My self-confidence and belief in my talent and future has withered away to small pieces now. All of the pain that I’ve suffered from working out and constantly grinding seems like it was a waste. I struggle to express my emotions severely so it may seem like the way this text or message was written with not enough emotional appeal. Today, I opened up to my school counselor and it just didn’t do anything. No one truly understands what it’s like. No matter to how many people I talk, nothing gets better. I suffer from OCD compulsions and cannot suffice myself with the issues these compulsions bring. I’ve also written a suicide note, but I just don’t have the courage to do it, or even have completely given up. 

If you have any feedback or advice, please feel free to reach out and talk to me. It would mean a lot.",1
Emotional blunting,"Does anyone else have a complete lack of negative emotions as well as positive? For quite some time now I've been devoid of negative emotions, no sadness, loneliness, pain or fear. Like things that would normally make me feel sad or lonely now make me feel nothing at all, I simply can't care anymore and I don't know if that's good or bad. Anyone else?",1
THE Lego and Depression,"I picked up a Lego yesterday. THE Lego. The. Fucking. Lego. The one that had been taking up residence next to the TV stand. For months now, I saw it everytime I vacuumed. It would have taken a second to pick it up. It would have taken a second to just vacuum the thing up. And I just couldn't. All logic aside, I couldn't will myself to pick up the damn thing. Something so miniscule seemed like such a heavy burden. 

 And let me tell You, Dear Reader, the feeling of victory after throwing this bitch ass Lego in the Lego box (all of 3ft away) was IMMENSE. And then it wasn't. After realizing I had somehow placed my mental health and overall well-being on this tiny Lego, I broke. 

Anxiety and Depression are thieves. Thieves of joy, thieves of perspective and reality, thieves of Life in true abundance. Sneaky, creeping, thieves. They will take and take and take and take until you find yourself swimming in despair. Or sitting numb on the couch. Watching life happen. Wanting to participate but not really knowing how when everything (and I truly mean everything) seems like too much. 

Yesterday was about brokenness. Acknowledging and embracing it. Sitting with those gut-wrenching, raw, uncomfortable feelings and truths and letting them fester instead of covering them with the temporary band-aid of whatever vice or shitty coping mechanism I was feeling at the moment. 

Today is about healing. Genuine healing. And it sucks balls. Big ones. Healing and recovery is messy. Its hard trying to figure out how to clean up an emotional mess you didn't create.
Hard but doable. 

Pick up the Lego. 

Sit with those feelings.

Fix your damn self.

And drink some water.

Just one of those days.,"It started out so fine today, but you know it kinda just started going down hill. The sad thoughts just started piling in, and made it so hard to actually function I just wanted to get hurt today. Hoping they go away by tomorrow. 

Thanks for reading my feelings.",1
Numb,I feel numb. Very few things give me pleasure lately. Things I used to enjoy doing or things that used to be entertaining feel exhausting. It’s all I can do in the morning to get up  and get myself to work. Lately I feel tired of living. I’m tired of having to put on a face and act like I’m ok. I barely even feel other emotions anymore. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear.,1
Confused (M22),I don't talk to anyone else except my girlfriend. Whenever i try to leave her or tell her to change she straightforward blame me for it saying i don't give her enough time. Recently i found out she has been talking to other boys from some app and blamed me for not talking to her. She has blamed me for having too much emotion nd wanting to talk to her(Yes she is the same girl who blames me for not giving time). I couldn't express any of my feelings as whenever i tried i am told idiotic. I really wanna leave her but i donno how to. Everytime i try she will come to me crying. I can't hurt anyone. Today is my birthday and she blamed me for accepting me nd blocked me again from everywhere. Its 4 AM(in india) and i still can't sleep.,1
They probably hate me,"Looking at my friends being happy and doing things and going out and enjoying life is so difficult… I’m literally worthless. And on top of that, they’d be so much better off without some stupid miserable blob with no energy and will to live. I’m in their way. Why would have a mess in a nice good life?? I wish they’d just tell me they don’t want me anymore, at least I wouldn’t constantly hope for attention. I’m just trash",1

I'm Sick Of Feeling Hurt,"It's been about a year now since I met people online that claim to taken interest in me or asked me out or whatever. Prior to this, I've always felt like there was something wrong with me and that I can't find love. But I met people online.

The first person I talked to really liked me so much but felt insecure about themselves and cut me off, but found out they're just looking elsewhere.

The second person I liked actually reached out to me and I thought we were hitting things off until they tried saying shit to push me away deliberately.

The 3rd person I met I decided it would be best to take things slow, they eventually asked me out to only say a week later they didn't want to date, but came back to me a month later that she's dating a guy she only met for a week after me and her talking for 8 months.

The 4th person, I didn't even get the chance to say that I liked them before they blocked me over an argument that her friend started with me.

Now the 5th person, I've known for a year now, was starting to flirt with me and say they love me and stuff. I actually thought I found someone, until they heard from an old friend of theirs they haven't heard from for 2 years started talking and the one I liked asked them out. So the flirting and the 'I love yous' meant nothing?

I know, go through 5 people in a year? That's crazy. The first two were rushed due to them kinda wanting the relationship fast, the 3rd person I built in the friendship and they even asked me out only to say they don't want it. The 4th person I actually regret even liking. But now I'm hurting the most with the 5th person I loved because I got to know them better than the other 4 people.

I can't stop crying, I want to hurt myself because nobody will ever care about me, I've already stopped believing in love once again, but I'm still hurting so much. I can't keep doing this, I don't want to keep getting hurt anymore.",1
"if I’m allowed to rant, I’ll feel much better for it. Thanks","Currently washed with an overwhelming feeling of underachievement. Like I have lived life for 40 years and nothing to show for. Weighed under by the realisation that I’m a failure. Had always thought I could have done a lot more. Above average IQ, good financial planning, generally happy family but happiness always eluded me due to irrational anxiety and gloom view of everything. Thrown everything in disarray and kept family and friends away (but then I think to myself that nobody cares!)… frustrating but I think I just need a good hot shower and a long sleep. 

 Just ranting.",1
i cant do it anymore,"it’s been 18 years of this, and i don’t know if i can do it anymore. my parents have been mentally and physically abusive my whole life. i’ve come to the conclusion recently that they do not love me. they do nothing at all to support me and i’ve never been enough for them. i cant remember the last time i saw either of them smile at me. i want them to love me so bad.",1
I’m just going to die,"That’s it. I’ve known forever I was going to do it. And now it’s the time. I’m waiting for the right weather which I have to wait for months (being nostalgic ugh), going to go to the seaside, stare at the sea and just die. I’m not fit for living, I’m just not.",1
21yo and nothing seems right,"Hi, I'm a 21 years old woman living in Europe. I'm a living failure, never had a job or an appartement, virtual relationships only, no irl friends and stoped school after 2 years in a University, I don't even have a driver's license. I also have a social anxiety disorder, I'm morbidly obese and look horrible. 

I've been trying for the past 5/6 years to become the person I've always wanted to be, I've been going to the psychologist, the psychiatrist, the addictologist ( for food ) and I even went to a one month program to help with my weight, sport and my mental health. I've also been trying to look better, putting some makeup on, changing haircut, taking care of my skin and more. Even with all the things I've been doing I'm still getting worse, I gain even more weight, my mental health is terrible and I'm obviously not good looking ( but I wasn't expecting much on that side anyways). 

I feel guilty for my parents that don't know what to do with me, I just wish I never woke up sometimes just so my parents wouldn't worry about me anymore. I know that my close family is ashamed of me and it's killing me on the inside, they havent told other family members that I stopped University because of how ashamed they are of me. Since the age of 8 I've always wanted to end my life, I was being bullied really badly and my family was a total mess and still is but now it's because of me and I can't think about it without crying.

(24M) I still can't get over my last breakup late last summer,"Every day, it hurts me. I fear that I have lost my best chance. I cannot escape the feeling. I take so long to grieve. I have lost hope in being able to find a partner for the first time since highschool (meaning, I haven't felt this kind of dread since then, for clarification).

I can't distract myself for long enough to escape this. I really want this feeling to end, but I'm afraid that it won't until I find a new girlfriend, but I don't see that as being possible anymore. It is pure dread. My life's been at a dead end, and there's no self help that could cure such a feeling in me.

I grieve not just the relationship, but myself. I was lucky to have even dated while I had the chance. Several chances. My luck has definitely run out.

She told me that I'll never find what I'm looking for, and I believe her. I feel like a living corpse now. 

If the rest of my life feels this way, I don't know how I'll go on.",1
I hate myself,"I have been struggling with depression all my life, shitty time growing up. I've had this forever and I remeber being a kid thinking ""one day I'll get out, I'll work hard now and then later I'll be able to relax"" instead I wasted my childhood. I have a shit connection with all my family and I hate my body. I am not in the process of a suicide plan buy I feel like I switch between so many unhealthy behaviours of addiction and eating disorder and self harm to try to make things better because I can't stand to live in this world, especially sober. 

I just wish I could be happy, like genuinely. I've given up on thinking I'll achieve the happiness I use to have and that ""getting better"" is just dealing with the shit all day",1
I feel like such a shit mom,"Let me start off by saying I absolutely love and adore my kids. As cliche as it sounds, they’re the light of my life and my reason for waking up every morning. But I feel like the worst mom in the entire world and that they deserve so much better. Would they be better off without me? The thought constantly lingers in and out of my mind for months now. I am trying to be more conscious of my actions and what I’m truly teaching my boys including mannerisms and behavioral social understandings. I want them to learn how to deal with frustration and anger in a healthy way. Definitely different than how I’ve been taught. 
I wake up everyday with the intention to be the best I possibly can be. I am in school to finish my BS degree and continue into a career I’ve dreamed of for years. I was working full time during the semester due to being the sole provider with my SO out on disability leave for some surgeries. Now, SO is back to work, work is only 4 days instead of 5 due to our alternating schedules. I enjoy the extra time off to spend it with my boys and study. I take my education seriously and I want to be able to not only provide but also set myself as a role model for my children. I believe if you work hard young then it will pay off when you’re older. I’m not that young but not that old, 26 in a few weeks but not too old to finish out school. 
My SO makes me feel like absolute shit for going to school. I take most of my classes online and maybe 1 or 2 hybrid (online and lecture once weekly). I’m constantly being reminded of how I’m a horrible mom bc I am studying instead of braiding my children’s hair. I’m not the best at doing their hair and have wanted to cut it for some time now but their father doesn’t want that so I respect that. 
I want to just give up. I blow up at the dumbest shit now. I yelled at my 4 year old bc he just wouldn’t listen and I feel horrible. I feel like such a shitty mom. I would get home around 9 with the expectation of cooking dinner on the night of class, only 2 nights a week. Mind you, after working from 9am-5pm then school from 6-8:40 for two nights a week. For a semester, not including the days off for development days for the professors or whatnot. I was exhausted and I felt as if the 3 & 4 year old should’ve been to sleep by then. But no, they’re up late and more wild than ever. I feel so alone. When I’m hurt, he’s never there in a comforting manner ready to be there for me like someone you care for. I’m not cared for and I’m always made to be the bad guy in the situation. My kids aren’t stupid and they’re old enough to remember this and grow that resentment over time. I would die if my kids hated me. I feel like they will. I yelled at them for spilling their cereal all over their bed after asking them to sit at the little table and eat so they don’t make a mess and can watch their little show. I don’t beat my children unless you consider a slight whack on the bum, thigh or hand abuse. Nothing like a hit but a little more than a tap after constant asking to stop something. Nobody listens to me not even my kids.  Nobody is even going to read this shit I’m rambling about anyway so what’s the point of being alive. I’m nobody.

Born This Way,"28/F-Employed Mother-Married

I've always been a little sad. It seeps into my life at even the happiest moments. I've tried therapy and drugs (medical). Nothing lasts long and it always comes creeping back in.

I just signed a lease on a vehicle earlier this year because I really needed a vehicle. Now I'm working part time on top of my regular job just to try and catch up. I've borrowed from friends and family just to get enough to eat each week. It seems like no matter how much I cut back expenses or work extra I'm just constantly drowning.

I feel like an incompetent idiot constantly, inferior and foolish. I feel too small and the world is crushing down on me despite my best efforts. I try so hard every day just to barely make it. I'm so tired of trying, I don't want to live like this for another 50 some odd years. 

I feel like atlas and Prometheus rolled into one. Eternally tormented.

I want to break down.,"I’ve had a rough go about things in life, as I’m sure a lot of people in here have.

Yes, everyone in my life knows the struggles I’ve gone through/ continue to, but no one has ever asked me if I’m really okay, or how those things really make me feel.

a little about my life,"I grew up in an extended family with grandparents brothers and their family with all uncles together cousins together adding to rich cultural childhood with having a proper village and knowing the true farmers and village lifestyle as well as well foreign education and was settled there for years . But now I'm leading such life where I'm distant with everyone ( thou I don't blame myself for that, in this generation families are meant to break with brothers or anyone having conflicts within themselves back to main topic) I've successfully no relationship with any relatives and in future might even leave my parents ( or they won't accept me) i wonder what life has to offer, the career I'm hoping into thanks to covid I've lost my interest in that and it is about time that I'll have no purpose in life at all. 
Now that i look back at things i was very fortunate about the things i had, I've interesting stories to tell some happy some prankssome sad and some fascinating but all these stories have stopped coming now that i look at my life from past 5 years I've no story no good experience thou, i did plenty of things where other people might enjoy but everyday I'm at constant battle, battle within myself the choices I've to make but it's not something that I've made.
Life doesn't have to be all great everyday i get it. But atleast at nighttime it should get me an easy sleep instead of so many thoughts and regrets making me awake.",1
38M- I'm just so tired and alone,"I've never done anything like this before so I don't know where to start.  I'm a 38 year old male.  I live at home still because at 18 I was diagnosed with Crohns disease and even though I have a good job that I love at a company that I've worked for for since I was 18, luckily I was hired about 4 months before my diagnosis for insurance, I don't make enough money to be able to live alone because of medical expenses and then the constant threat of possibly having to be out for an extended period due to a severe flare up.  I've tried over the years different things like picking up overtime out at my job and also getting a second job.  Unfortunately what happens is my body can do it for a while but eventually starts going to hell.  Well over the last 20 years I also had to be on heavy cortical steroids a lot and they caused me to have a lot of weight gain from that and I now know that I was Insulin resistant so about 2 years ago I was 474lbs so my doctors worked out for me to get gastric sleeve surgery. Fast forward to today.  Im down to 280lbs and over the last 6 months or so I have just been realizing that I'm alone and my life has no future and probably always will be.  Don't get me wrong I have the best family on the world and we are all real close and I get to live in a wonderful house, I have 2 nice cars so and so on.  But what good is all that if you don't have anyone to share it with and with the situation I'm in no women is every going to go for it.  I have what my doctors call a complicated case of Crohns which is never going to get better and so that has basically locked me in to where I'm at at work because no one is going to take me with my problems so I'm always going to have the money issue not to mention the not so much of what if but when am I going to have another major flare up.  So while I love my situation for its security at the same time its my problem because the one thing I've always been afraid of is being alone and now as I've gotten so much weight off so I feel like I'm at least physically acceptable I've realized that I'm not societally or financially acceptable and I just feel stuck and lost.  It hasn't bothered me so much over the years because I had so many other issues that I guess I hid it even to myself and I'm just really seeing it now.  On top of that I also have a new manager at work that came on about a year ago and he came from outside our group and he feels threatened by me, his words no mine, when I say things because I've been at this job eleven years and trained everyone here so they look to me for all the answers not him.  Because of that he makes every conversation with me a confrontation. Its made work something that I used to love something I dread.  Today I was so anxious I went to the bathroom and threw up from my nerves.  So with all this hitting at once I don't know what to do I just am lost and don't know what to do.  The one thing I'm afraid of most, being alone forever, is happening and I feel like I'm on a path of no future forever and am not going to be able to change it.  I hope this wasn't so long and crazy that you cant understand any of it its just kind of pouring out of me.",1
20M completely lost. Please help me.,"Hello to everyone. Im 20yo male living in third world country. I finished highschool 1 year ago and during these 12 mknths i havent done anything. I feel trapped, sick and weak. Depression is making me so dumb and insecure. Sometimes i feel so childish for having these problems.. I keep telling myself my feelings are not valid. I have both eyes, arms, parents, everythjng i need to start bulding my own life. But i keep being.. This. Peace of shit. I hate myself. 

Like a coward. Like im not able to do anything. I know i gotta work, but i cant. Like something is holding me. Something telling me that i am not capable of doing any job. Im having trouble finding purpose. Lately i see the world as a trash can. I am supposed to find a job, then buy a car, then buy better car, then..its just a circle everyone goes through.. Im so tired. I want to give up. 

I didnt go to get therapy because i dont know how a doctor can help me.. I imagine him telling me get your ass up you stupid idiot and get to work.. Your parents are working hard so you have something to eat and you dokt even have respect... 
And guys, i really have respect, i would give everything to be normal and to be normal child for my parents as they expect me to be... 

I didnt go to uni because unis in my country suck and they dont offer the major i want. My parents are slowly leading me to suicide. Ive started cutting one month ago, every time my parents tell me im a failure, im behind all my friends, im useless. 
Like.. I knlw all that stuff, of course i get that im useless, jobless and just wasting money and air. I dont know how they think that repeating the same thing is gking to help me guys...

Im really bad right now and its just getting worse.. Im really sad and scared. I would love someone to talk to me. If someone is in the same situation.. Im reading the comments. Thanks for everyone in forward. Im sorry i couldnt explain the situation better. This looks like a 12 years old boy rant after breaking up with his first love.",1
idk anymore if life is worth it.,"I had my baby 3 months ago, I was so happy never was depressed.  Until a few weeks ago, my dad texted me told me to fuck off. Haven't really talked to him since. Then my car starts fucking up, then my husband now has to have surgery thats going to put him out for a few weeks. A friend now wants nothing to do with me. My brother found out he has cancer and the first thing he tells me and my husband is that he has no respect for us. 


 We have no money, no food. Noone to help, why did we bring children into our fucking life. They don't deserve to struggle and starve, they don't deserve a piece of shit mother. I grew up without a mom, my children will be just fine. 

I just wanna die. I wanna just die. I don't wanna be alive anymore. I don't want to be miserable anymore. I don't want to continue to make my children suffer. 

Why are we doing this. I wanna run my car into the lake and just die. 
I'm tired of never having anything.",1
Does it get better?,I feel like I’m having such a hard time achieving anything at this point. I feel like I’m running in place! Every time somethings slightly goes my way I hit a wall bigger than before. I just feel like bad things keep happening to me and I have no control over it. I try to be cautious as possible and pushing myself but I get no where.,1
I feel so lost,"Today I got kicked out of my college. For the last semester I’ve been on academic probation, my mental health has plummeted and I haven’t been able to focus on anything, I’ve been through two of the hardest break ups in my life, I’ve tried to kill myself numerous times, I’ve almost bought one way tickets out of here and nothing is helping. In a week I’ll be 21 years old and I’m now laying in bed contemplating if I really want to make it to that. I haven’t told my parents about the academic probation or being kicked out and I don’t know how, they won’t look at me as their son anymore I’ll be the disappointment of the family and the thing they wasted three years of their money on. I have so much pain inside of me that I can’t figure out what I’m supposed to do next. I want to push everyone and everything away, I want to run so fast and never look back. I don’t know if I’ll make it to next week or even tomorrow, I just want to tell my parents that I tried my best and I’m so sorry I didn’t make it, I wish I didn’t struggle as bad as I did or lose focus or get frustrated. I wish I could’ve made them proud.",1
"If she can't make it, how can I?","There's this older girl I always used as inspiration to keep going and trying, as they were struggling with similar problems as I am. Compared to the exact same person constantly, feeling pressured, overworked. I guess I saw a bit of myself in her. But she was still so strong and successful, and she kept going, so I thought I could too.

Recently they committed suicide, how can I make it through if she can't? She was so strong. Is it bad that I see myself in her, and that I feel I'm going to have the exact same fate?",1
Cant seem to stop feeling blue..,"\*I posted this on r/advice but I found this community recently and wanted to share it here as well\* 

I came across a few posts of people opening up and others giving advice and/or relating to them. I'm hoping to share my thoughts and feelings for sort of relief/comfort/advice. (Also post contains self-harm/suicide attempt)

I have always delt with depression and anxiety. Mid high school years is where it started to get worse and I reached out for help. I started to self harm a lot and isolated myself. At first I went to cutting as a form of the build up emotions, but then I started to think negative things about myself and started to hate myself I would legit say things like ""you're fucking pathetic/useless/worthless, I absolutely hate you, you don't deserve to be better, you are a horrible person, etc."" I started to say these things to myself as if there were two of me fighting one another. I haven't done anything to be a horrible person, but when it came to me I wanted to believe that for my case specifically, I don't need a reason to think of myself as one. That's when the self harm went from relief to a way of just watching myself suffer.

Fast forward a couple of years, I stopped self harming after two somewhat suicide attempts and started to go to therapy. therapy is honestly a god sent. I always recommend it to others even if they aren't going through anything specific bc it can always be helpful. I saw a psychiatrist and now have been on meds for the past twoish years. Although I feel like I have grown and progressed, that internal feeling of loneliness, emptiness, and exhaustion is always there. I do have self harm temptations here and there and I feel like I'm constantly in my head. I tend to get overwhelmed super fast with most of it being physical sensations that make it worse. For example, on top of the constant spiraling thoughts I can't seen to stop, my body always feels uneasy. I don't know how to properly explain it but its a mixture of heaviness, tingling, hot face/neck/head that seems never to cool down, foggy head, nausea and headache. Basically everything feels like a drag tbh.

I feel a bit embarrassed writing this as I don't tell others what goes on in my head (which is the reason this post is all over the place and confusing haha sorry) and I usually have the fear of being judged by others. Like I truly am not trying to fish for compliments, asking for pity, trying to get attention, etc. Trust me, I am uncomfortable with me writing this rn since I don't want bother others. I just honestly want to hide and disappear, not getting in anyone's way and not interacting with others. I hate it when I'm in a situation where the attention is directed at me and I am scared that when I start to put myself out there, no one would want to be with me. Like what if I stop feeling the need of constantly providing something to others/put others first to feel okay? This habit started when I was really young but I can't even think of what could happen if I stop putting others first. I have a strong feeling that if I am not providing something to the other person they will leave. That just me myself won't ever be enough to make someone stay. And I know it sounds crazy and stupid and I have tried to get out of that cycle by talking to others by either trying to start new friendships or initiating the ""talking stage"" with crushes but I just end up getting ghosted. I just don't know what to do, and I feel so uneasy and I can tell I'm starting to let go of myself.

I just feel like a big blob (thats the best way I can sum it up, just a blob). But yeah, that is my long vent and I'm sorry if it is all over the place. I'm not sure what I want out of it, but I hope it helps others feel less lonely who are going through something similar. If I planned out this post before actually typing, I would have probably added other things and made it more concise, since theres other things I'd want to mention :) but maybe that can be for an updated post or something idk. And if you are reading all the way down to here, thank you so much for taking the time and interest, I really do appreciate it. I hope to hear your thoughts, questions, etc and would love to get to know you. Take care :)",1
"I'm considering ending my friendship with my ""best friend""","I've known my best friend for a long long time.    For a while he was not a good kid, but then he underwent a ""spiritual transformation"" at our church and he became a lot better person.  I started talking with him more and we got pretty close.    Closest I had ever had with someone. Like ever. Me and my family would even have him stay with us on our vacation every year for a few days.

Unfortunately, he has some flaws like we all do, (I'm no saint) but it's getting to the point of being unbearable for me.

He's kinda manipulative of people and he almost always thinks he understands everything about someone just from a brief view of something going on (like a little fight in our family yet he doesn't know the context or anything but he gives his opinion almost as fact and it's annoying af).   Hes very outgoing and suave and has a intriguing personality that draws people in but it's mostly just a mask and falsehood and I can't stand people who aren't authentic.   He's recently become extremely hypocritical as far as his vocal beliefs/standards are.   He sleeps around a lot and is kinda sexist to women.  Yet he tells people how wrongful and sinful it is to ""commit fornication"" and any sexual act. Even porn is a ""sin"" yet he's fucking like 7 different chicks, some within days of eachother. ""I have options"" he told me.    He acts like he's trying to be pure in public to keep up his false image but he's anything but.    He condemns homosexuality yet admitted to me he loves lesbian porn. Like, hey you do you I have no problem with people's sexual lives as long as they're not hurting anyone and kids aren't involved (obviously) but don't be a lying hypocrite about it. Esp in such a loud way.

He's also extremely self obsessed.

Sadly Ive been considering ending the friendship. Not just because of his personality, but he never calls or texts. He barely asks how I am after my recent surgery. He couldn't (or wouldn't is more likely) come see me before surgery even tho I asked multiple times. (I couldn't drive because of the injury and now I'm not allowed to because of the surgery recovery so I see literally nobody but family) he hasn't offered to come see me since said surgery and it's been almost 2 months.   He broke my trust going through my YouTube history behind my back recently cause my YouTube was still logged into his TV from my phone even though I had asked him months prior to log me out and he said he would     Then fucking uses it against me saying the stuff I watch is causing my clinical depression and anxiety. 🙄😒

I can't trust him anymore, and I'm afraid of personal things I've told him that maybe he's told others that are not meant to be repeated and I've specifically asked not to be repeated. I have no clue of knowing the truth from him anymore.   

I'm just so done.     I stopped reaching out once and he didn't message me at all in over 6 weeks. And when he did it was him bragging about something he did or something new he got.     I stopped reaching out last week and haven't heard anything.    I'm done being the one to always pursue any type of communication.    

I get he's busy and has a social life, but for me being his so called ""Best and closest friend I've had"" he doesn't treat me that way. He makes time to be around others but can't with me.

I'm not a selfish person, so I'm really struggling with just wanting to say ""Fuck it. I'm done."" But this kind of stuff has been going on for years now and is getting worse. I'm just at a breaking/decision point and I'm not really sure what to do.",1
No motivation- suggestions?,I am struggling with motivation to do anything. Can’t work out. Can’t do my job. Can’t clean my room. Don’t want to  do anything really. Even fun things that come up. What are some things that have helped you get back on track? I could really use some inspiration.,1
I’m finally ready..,"I wonder what my life could have been like in a couple of years. 

I’ve always dreamt about having a small family of my own, with a beautiful wife and tiny little kids running around. 

I often think about what our lives would be like. All the holidays that we could’ve enjoyed together as a family, all the trips around the world, all the family dinners and reunions, all the anniversaries and all the little things in between. 

It breaks my heart that I will never live those moments and that my life had to end so soon after 27 years filled with melancholy and agony. 

I wonder what my loved ones would think of me and how would they cope..

I’m truly sorry for the pain that I’m about to cause to anyone who cares about me. I appreciate each and every single one of you. You did all you could and more and I’m grateful for it. 

I sincerely wish that it had ended differently, but it’s just too much..

Please keep me in your prayers..

I love you M. 

Goodbye.",1
I realized that I hate myself,"So I've posted before on here many times, and I realized recently that I hate hate myself. I don't like where I am in my life and I don't see any worth or value to me or anyone. The main reason I'm depressed is that I want to be in a relationship because I hate being alone. People have told me that I can't love someone else until I learn to love myself. So how do I do that? It just feels impossible to me",1

I'm not angry on him or anything, it's a obvious choice and I hope she will be better.

my story,"Hey everyone I rlly hope your all doing well and having a great day.

So recently life hasn't been treating me well and I'm rlly struggling to cope with everything. But first of all a little bit about myself I dropped out of high school recently to persuade a apprenticeship and certificate course. I play guitar and piano love music the beach and travelling

anyways to the most important stuff, 

So atm I really feel like everyday I struggle so much to  live day by day. The first thing that really bugs me is dropping out of school not because I didn't graduate, because what I'm doing in my apprenticeship is worth more than a high school grad certificate. (still regret it but ill talk about it below) Its the part of being lonely. I never really had any **true friends** my whole life they're more just people that are there. And ever since putting my band and school for work I've been so freaking lonely I feel like I have nobody to turn to, I feel so sad, I have nobody to hang out with or share things with. Like literally I have zero friends. everyday I struggle so much cause I feel like I have such a void in my heart of lonliness.  I love my family but friends are different you have your guys u spend the rest of ur life chilling with and then u meet some girls who to help find someone special. I have none of that and ever since leaving I've never been able to fill that feeling. even at school I wasn't really anybody friend I was just there. and I always have to make plans if I do wanna do anything but these fake friends I wouldn't even connect with. And I honestly hang out at the shop alone, hang out at the beach alone I wanna go to concerts and festivals but with who......

another thing that is really bothering me is my job for the last 3 years I've been telling my parents and the people around me this is the work I wanna do I love this. and since having it 10 weeks in and I fucking dread going everyday (btw I work in tech and AV).  I HATE everything about the work its not what I wanna do, when I ask the technicians who are training me how to do things they get real mad at me, I get teased for not being able to lift heavy things or be expected to know things when I don't BECAUSE IM A FUCKING APPRENTICE!!!!!!! and the whole thing just upsets me I don't connect with anyone I sit alone at lunch I get no support and I get treated like shit. I really wanna leave but I'm sacred about letting the people down around me its too late to go back to HS because all my senior yr / yr12 groups now doing they're mid-final exams.  I can leave and do a another certificate course at TAFE (for those who r not Australian TAFE is a college where u can get a degree to get into college for ppl who didn't do well in HS or get a career either in trade, IT, business u name it pretty much anything). my problem is I'm scared of telling my parents and just fucking making the stupid decision of leaving HS I regret it and taking up this. I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AT SCHOOL AND KEPT WORKING AT THE SUPERMARKET ON THE WEEKEND. I have non time to have fun and everything just shits me

Plus I'm very insecure I'm 5'5 I'm not ripped all, I have a few very mild medical problems that have ran thru the family that I gotta deal with (nothing life treating) but everything just bothers me I feel like I was put on this earth to be a failure. I cry myself to sleep most nights I just want someone to hug and love

If it wasn't for music, playing guitar and piano, the money I make, travel, and the outdoors plus my family and all the special ppl here  Id be so much worse

and all these build up to why I'm so depressed and alone and anxious. I always have butterflies I feel empty, I'm becoming socially awkward cause I have no one, I cry heaps and I'm always down and just want the weekend. 

and ik what u wanna say try new hobby or do something new I've tried that nothing is seeming to work. I'm stuck pls help. if ur up to this point I love u sm and I ty for reading my stupid fucking shit and would appreciate some help and pls tell me to if I'm over reacting I want a true response 

Take care all, ml.",1
33F - Living at home my entire life has stunted my growth. Is it too late?,"Somehow life REALLY passed me by. I'm now 33 and I've never moved out of my mom's house. She does everything for me, even when I don't want her to. 

I can barely afford to live alone but I feel like I absolutely wasted my most important years of growth. Though I did travel quite a bit in my 20's...I haven't really grown as a person. 

I am still in a dead-end job and I'm immature compared to most. I have trouble holding friends and relationships. I'm really depressed and unsure why I didn't have this realization at 23...and not at 33. 

Have I seriously stunted my mental growth and is there any hope for me? I'm angry at myself for letting me waste my life like this. Especially since life is so short.",1
I’m unlovable. There’s no hope.,I ruin everything. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fucking fault. I hate this. I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to anyone about anything. It hurts so much.

26M Still living at Parents House and Depressed because of it.,"Hi, I’m a 26Y Male. I’m the Youngest of 4 Siblings and I’m the 2nd oldest so far to live at home (my oldest sister moved out at 28 after she got married) and I’m extremely depressed because of it. I live in a rural Area where everything is Cheap but I hate it here because of how depressing it is and the people in general are mentally stuck in the 80’s still. There are no opportunities here for a job in my field, my best bet is the full time job i have right now at Amazon making $19/hr as an Assistant Supervisor trying to make it to Management but having no success despite the hard work I have put. The job is 40 Miles away straight highway thankfully or else I would go insane. My parents are immigrants from Eastern Europe, 62 & 65 and don’t make much $$ so I’m paying for my share. Which is around 50% of everything. I have a new car and saving up more $$ just to buy my Fiance (24Y Female) a car because her mom ruined her credit and I’m trying hard to pay for half because I want to help her get a better job so we can get more combined income to get out. But it’s just so hard to save, is it okay to feel this way? I just feel like a loser because I still live at home and my Fiance isn’t allowed to move in because of how my parents beliefs are. I love my father to death but the thought of leaving worries me since they are old and only my Oldest sister (39Y) helps take care of the rest of the bills while the other Two don’t. I don’t know how to stop feeling this way or what to even do anymore besides wait more and save more.",1

Tired,"That’s the answer I always give to “how are you doing?” Always asked by people who don’t really care. Tired. I have zero social life outside of working out at the gym, in where I don’t talk to people anyway, and no matter if I really am, I always feel…tired. 

I’m 33, father of a beautiful 3 year old, a wife who I dated for a month before getting pregnant, in school for my bachelors which I hope to finish next May and my life is Work, School, Gym, TV/Video games. On repeat. Every week. Every month. Every year for the last 6 years. I also work by myself, driving from store to store as a vendor, so no coworkers either. No real friends. And I only say real because I have 2 acquaintances…that are quickly showing me that I’m likely the absolute last person they talk to, when they’re bored or lonely or at work. It’s the only time I ever hear from em. When I ask to hang out, they never can. So I’m done asking. 

I had all of Saturday to myself yesterday as my wife worked. No work or homework to do. Played video games, and as I played them, I just didn’t care. So tired of video games. Tired of having no one to call to hang out with. My wife doesn’t have friends either so she has as much social life as me. Idk if it bothers her the way it does me. She seems content. But I’m bored. Not that in love if at all. We had an oopsie baby before I got to know her. And that kid is the light of my entire life. 

But as for my wife, she’s a good mom but, we have so little in common. We started seeing each other to be friends w benefits back when I had coworkers. We fucked up. Did the “right” thing and got married. 

Anyway, if you got this far, I think I’m depressed, not suicidal, not a harm to others, a normal, average joe with so much love to give just caving into himself, acting strong for his kid and his wife. But it’s getting tougher every day. Have a good day everyone.",1
I am slowly slipping back down into the darkness,"As the title says I can feel myself slowly slipping back into a deep depression again. Things have been looking up over the last few months - I quit drinking and smoking and had been making progress in my life. I had started therapy with an online therapist which was helping I think. 3 weeks ago she said she was unwell and unable to do sessions that week and since then I have not heard from her I think maybe she is ghosting me. I can feel my thoughts getting darker each day and my routine is falling apart. Last month I was early to bed, early to rise and motivated to be a part of my family and to work but right now all I want to do is be in bed.",1
Can’t wait to get it over with,"It sucks…. It sucks to be so young and yet in so much pain. I don’t know where to take it to. I’m an only child and my parents are both working. I actually calculated, 12 out of my 16 hour day from waking up at 6:30 and going to bed at 10:30 I’m alone, i.e. 75% of my whole day. Even after work my parents are busy with their work and if they see me sitting around chatting with them or asking them to get off their phone they tell me to go study.
I honestly cannot blame them. They’re my parents and they can only fulfill that role in my life. They cannot be my friends. I’ve got a close knit of best friends too. But I always feel like that one friend in the group that’s just there. I love them to death and ik they do too but the only time we basically even talk is in school during our breaks or wtv. It’s not really their fault, I don’t text. I’m just not a text kinda person.
I’m just so drained I want it to be over already. As I mentioned before I’m an only child and parents are quite on the older side. They’re gonna need me very soon after retirement . Everything they’ve done so far is for me and I can’t just selfishly leave them and go. 
This sounds really terrible but I can’t wait till they’re dead so that I can go with them.",1
New feature on reddit that may help ease the minds of many of you wanting to be heard.,"Many of you post on here and unfortunately get no upvotes and no responses. We have written in the sidebar:

>As this subreddit has a relatively small community, your post may not always receive comments. We are actively visited by a fair number of people, however, and you can be assured that your post has been read and that you have been heard.

I know that's often not a comfort to you, and it makes you feel more alone and more ignored. I've tried to explain to many that as far as upvotes, unless your post title is some obvious, *I also think that* title (think DAE's or ""Life isn't fair"" or ""depression is hard""), people don't often upvote posts in serious subreddits like these, especially ones about mental health. People don't come here to upvote posts in popularity and widespread view. They come to give and offer help. And as far as responses, many times people read your post and just don't comment, whether it be because they can't relate, don't know what words to say, don't have time, don't have any advice to offer, are insecure with their own thoughts... the list goes on. That does NOT mean you weren't *heard* and absolutely does not mean even people on the internet are ignoring you. Think of how many posts you've read and had no response to give.

Now when you go to your profile page, you will see a graph on the bottom right of your post submission. Click it. It will tell you post insights, including the total number of views. For example, the mod post I made earlier today has 8 upvotes. But the insights show 277 views. See how drastically different those numbers are? I have been heard and not ignored.

New features on reddit and almost always released in groups at a time and not widespread, so it's possible not everyone has this feature yet, and others have had this feature for almost a year. 

But hopefully this helps comfort some of you.",1
"Message from the mods: Do NOT report posts of people in need of help, including those threatening suicide.","We need you to stop reporting posts of people reaching out for help. Doesn't matter if they say they are suicidal and about to attempt it at that second. That is what our subreddit is for.

When a post is reported for threatening self harm, it is removed from our subreddit until one of us manually approves it. We are not on reddit 24 hours a day. 

*Which means it can be hours the person in need goes unheard. You are doing the exact opposite of helping them.*

Please refer to the posts on /r/SWResources for tips of what to say to someone who is at risk, and read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement) about how to avoid accidental incitement. You can also encourage the OP to also post on /r/SuicideWatch so additional people can see their post. 

You can also go to their profile and click on the option ""get them help and support."" This alerts the suicide hotline to contact the member to ask if they would like to talk. Please do not abuse this either. Use it only if the person is contemplating suicide, not just reaching out for support and advice. 

To chose this option, on the desktop version, go to their profile, and on the upper right side you will see under their username an option ""get them help and support."" On the app, go to their profile, and on the upper right side, you will see three dots. Click on those and chose ""get them help and support.""

One last thing. Do NOT tell a person who is suicidal to message you, and absolutely do not send an unsolicited message to an OP. This is for both of your protection. You could end up in way over your head and can actually push an OP over the edge. You are not a trained professional. Just keep talking to them on the post. 

r/suicidewatch outlines this rule, which fully applies to our subreddit's rules as well:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

>Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement. Either way, it's unwise to trust them.

>""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea. Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

>By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.

>People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders. It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole. Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole. Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone. It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.

>If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including moderators, to help. 

>In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively. Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny. If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts.

What you *should* report:

* Anyone threatening violence toward others

* Any comments or posts with descriptions of *how* to commit suicide (not just if the OP says, ""I will shoot myself."")

* Any comments encouraging OP to commit suicide 

* Comments that insult or attack anywhere on our subreddit

* ""I'm here to help"" posts (read SW's explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

* Comments telling OP's who are clearly at risk for suicide to private message 

* Any promotion of a religious ideology as a fix for depression, pain, etc and any comment about OP going to hell for suicide or assertions about a god or afterlife.

* Comments or posts making light of depression, blaming individuals for having it, or ridiculing mental illness

* Comments or posts that are self promotion (read my blog, etc)

* Comments or posts claiming they alone can help you (I cured myself, message me if you want to know how, etc)

* Posts asking for monetary help. There are subreddits for this that have rules in place to help verify the validity of users. We don't. 

* Posts or comments giving a diagnosis or medical advice, which includes any comment that tells others to not use medication.  

Extra notes:  to any user on our subreddit who receives an unsolicited message due to your post or comment on this subreddit that in any way you don't appreciate (examples of messages like this are insulting you for what you had to say, saying you need to find god, commenting on how you look... basically anything that upsets you or rubs you the wrong way and you feel was not acceptable, please send us a screen shot. 

*Private Message Solicitation- what we do and don't allow.* Our overarching goal of this subreddit is to keep users safe. I realize other subreddits allow users to solicit private message. All posts asking for private messages  on this subreddit are are removed. I'm sorry, but this is not the correct subreddit to post you are looking for friends or for someone to privately talk to. It's our own rules we've established for what we feel is safe. You have no idea who is contacting you, especially those that troll vulnerable subreddits. If other subreddits are different, that's their choice. Just like we don't allow graphic pictures and other subreddits do. 

As far as comments that mention private messaging. You have to first establish either some basic rapport with the OP or make a comment that shows you have something to offer (have gone through the same thing, you're the same age, etc) *and* acknowledge what OP actually said in their post. We will also check to see if you've contributed to our subreddit in the past. Comments left that just say, ""message me if you want to talk,"" and the like will be removed. 

And remember, we always air on the side of caution. If we feel you left a post or comment that shows you can be a threat to the vulnerability of users here, we will ban you to prevent that. No warning, just a ban- since many of these comments are not mistakes. You knew what you wrote was inappropriate when writing it. If you message us recognizing why your comment was inappropriate (or even ask us to explain the issue and then recognize it), we are often more than willing to reverse the ban. If you message us to attack us, you just proved our point of why you shouldn't be on this sub.

**Please feel free to message us with any questions or further explanation about our rules.** We take our responsibility modding a subreddit like this seriously. We take no joy in banning people. We want people to *want* to come to this subreddit. We want this subreddit to be seen in a positive light (despite the topic). We want more users so our OP's get more responses. We don't ban or make rules just to get our kicks. But at the end of the day, safety of the members of our community comes first.",1

Am really struggling. Feeling so defeated nothing makes sense.,"My life looks damaged beyond repair. At 33 & having been eternally single, I dont have anything except regrets....happy memories dont truly exist nor do I have anything to be proud of or to look forward to but somehow since last 5-6years my life is dragging on for the sake of family or social pressures.....everyday is tough but sometimes things become so painful I can't even find a reason of why I should continue living in a world that has no place for people like me. I was a good student but lack of guidance & family pressure of joining business instead of exploring different kindof ruined my life. Am stuck in a tribal area, no scope for marriage or relationship & no time for personal growth, most of my social life is hiding my present struggle. Friends have moved on to new chapters while I dont even know how am gonna go through this year.
I feel tired so often, at times I try to work out to stay in spirit but I dont have any real motivation as am stuck in life & I dont have the talent or time to make money at this stage. With no access to any lethal means...I do wish there was an instant way out because am certain I can't continue like this.",1

2 semesters of college and all I have left is a few fantasy dreams,"I have to move out of my dorm in 6 hours, and still haven't finished packing. I had to drop from all classes, after seeing a kid jump over a month ago. I thought I would be able to make it, even if I had some health issues. I was assisting a research paper, decent GPA, making new decent friends. But I don't know why, I felt so down.   


I started sleeping worse, worse dreams, muscles twitching more even when awake to the point of hitting myself. I became scared of going outside, as my dorm overlooked the building where he jumped. I stopped going to classes too, then stopped answering emails.   


I sleep 4-6hrs a day with sudden wakes every 2 hours. As I try to go back to sleep, I wish I'd dreamt something different. When the dreams stop being distressing, they usually are trivial, almost ordinary, but I don't feel any pain. They are about talking to elementary classmates, hugging my high school crush. The truth is, none of those scenes were ever true, and I wake up dreading both facts that I can't sleep more and those dreams sadden my already depressing mind. All I have is some fantasies my subconsciousness is desperate to make in order to cope with reality.  


Who can talk or do about all this? I've had therapy; I've tried opening up; heck, I've tried hanging myself for good measure. I'm just tired. I don't want to ask for advice or sympathy; I just want all this to stop. I just want to type this out of pathetic vanity.",1
Between a rock and a hard place.,"I (29m) had the only 4 members of my family that I’m close to (including a 4 yr old adopted brother) move to South Carolina while I live in Indiana. With not having very much family, I’ve created some extremely close bonds to a small group of friends and would give my life for any one of them in a heartbeat. I’ve made the decision to move to South Carolina to be with my family and especially to be there for my little brother.

Lately I have fallen into a severe depression because the thought of leaving my friends is eating at me. I have a huge fear of being lonely after I move and who knows how many years it could take to make new friends like the ones I have now.

Does anyone else have experience with this and can you tell me what you did to meet new people?",1
sometimes I think I'm not real,Sometimes I think I'm not real. This isn't real. It's like for all of these years I was going in one direction then suddenly I'm on the otherside of the country living someone else's life. I mean two months ago I had a family and we had a future. Now here I am living this bleak life crawling on a treadmill getting no where. I just hope these meds will work for me because I've never felt this opaque.

Am I depressed?,"I sometimes scratch myself until I bleed or until my whole arm or leg is red and bang my head against the wall sometimes but not a lot. There are some days I woke up and even if I want to to get up at this time I can't find motivation to actually get up 90% I go back to bed and whenever I'm left to my thoughts or when someone tells me to think about like the future or just life I feel like crying or just cry and just want to stop thinking. My mom and dad, especially my dad don't like how much I use the internet but if I'm not actively doing something, using the internet, drawing or talking to my sisters I just want to no longer to be able to think. I'm trying to think of the other things but I don't really want to, my mom wants me to see a therapist but my dad thinks I'm either being over dramatic or lying, I want to know if I'm depressed I don't really think I am but I also think scratching myself isn't really actually self-harm.

I've been thinking negatively, having suicidal thoughts about jumping in front of cars, cutting myself choking myself ect ect


I've been feeling lonely, feeling like nobody cares, no one likes me, and no one want it be around me

Been doing a mild version of self harm, like pinching myself, and scratching roughly

too scared to leave but too tired to stay 💔,"i used to always pride myself on my own happiness, how lucky i was to have such amazing parents, family and life… to only realise i had actually just been gaslighting myself for 19 years… 

though, i’m sure in my parents minds they love me, what they’re doing isn’t love, it’s control. i can’t leave the house without being called a bunch, any changes to my physical appearance makes my mum tell me she wishes she was dead, and well, my dad is just a clueless idiot. my parents had me 20 years after my biological sister and she left before i was born bc they were controlling and toxic too, however, idc if i’m being selfish by saying their treatment of me is worse since they hold her on a pedestal to compare me against … like i’m a her replacement tht went wrong bc shock horror … we’re not the same person… so they get annoyed @ me when i’m like her and annoyed @ me when i’m not like her … it’s like ‘my sister’s keeper’ except my dumb biological sister isn’t dying of cancer … the older ig the more i realise how much they just wanted a her 2.0 and are dissatisfied they got me instead … during ramadan, after a whole day of fasting, my parents don’t fast as they’re exempt, my mother won’t on a monologue abt how much my biological sister meant to her and how she didn’t deserve something so great so good took her away from her… as if i wasn’t right there …

my family life as a whole is p shit since i always find myself having to change for them … i find myself holding onto the little bread crumbs of affection they give me to stop me from disconnecting completely..

the only family members i truly feel loved by are very few.

a life of unresolved familial trauma caused me to become very self-destructive in my love life, ever since i was 16, i would attract possessive, incapable of loving me individuals who only further added to my trauma… like i couldn’t escape from my trauma, wherever i turn, at home it’d be from my parents and so i’d turn to a romantic love who’d also traumatise me, so i’d turn back to my parents, who would traumatise me and then traumatise me against whilst i’m healing from the last pain…

come covid and my mental health issues got worse and worse, i started becoming more and more destructive, overspending and getting my diagnosis and being put on anti-depressants, it’s just a negative progression at this point, at this point, i just try not to unalive myself everyday…

my life changed when i met the love of my life (at least what i thought at the time), it was like a fairytale, i’d never felt like tht for a person… he was visiting the city i’m from since a few of his cousins live here, and his cousin and i were at the same party to which his cousin invited him to, and he was so handsome .. ik i had to talk to him … and so i did … and automatically we both clicked until we both decided to leave the party early and so we did.. we went to a restaurant and … tht was our first date … i was his first kiss … and we spent 2 more days together … and i truly felt like cupid shot me, he was everything, in him i felt safe, heard, and loved … like, all the pain i’d ever felt was worth it bc i got him in the end, i even ended all my other relationships (i’m polyamorous) so i could give him all of my attention.. but of c no fairytale lasts, he left the city and went back to his own hometown, and his cyber communication was horrible, he’d go days without replying to me .. and i’d find myself becoming more and more unhinged waiting on his responses … but i told myself i’d try, for him and for myself, so we built our ideal future, where i’d move to his city to be w him, complete my studies and at the end he’d marry me and i’d settle there for good,,, the dream of a better future kept me going, our future kept me going ❤️‍🩹
and then came, well, he had been moved to another location by his job, and he was v sad and i was trying my best to make him laugh but i went wrong and he got upset w/ me and this just lead him to just being rly cold toward me which only made me try harder to give him my love, and so he broke up w/ me through text… and i can’t explain the depression i fell into .. i’ve never been so sad over a love in my life … especially since i had to have so many fights w/ my mum bc of him since she didn’t want me to be w/ him since he’s of a different religion.. she emotionally abused me and degraded me over it, but he was worth it… to me, he was always worth it, and when i cried and told my mum he broke up w/ me, she told me how glad she was 🥰🥰🥰 i can’t explain to you how hurt i was 

this lead to a 3 month bender of self-destruction once again … 

but ever since him, our relationship has changed, since i realised how conditional my mother’s love was for me.. during which time my best friend also told me tht i always ‘put my happiness in a man which is bad since men are ppl and ppl are unreliable’ and it took deep reflection w/ my mentor to realise how fucked tht was to say to a person who was heartbroken… 

it was heartbreaking tht @ a time when i needed their help and support, they just kicked me whilst i was down … my friend calls it infected tools used to treat an already deep wound 🤍

it’s taken a lot to learn to heal from it all, i’ve had to come to know a lot of uncomfortable truths:

• i’m not over him, and that’s okay, i need to forgive myself for grieving his loss and stop forcing myself to move on
 
• ppl i love, are still ppl, and ppl are cruel; they’re cruel bc i’m not like them  

• i’ll never find the love i give in a person

• i need no one to validate my sadness

• i need to leave my hometown…

i am now fighting off suicidal ideation everyday, wishing one day the pain will stop, i hope and pray one day it stops..

i’ve now gotten a place @ my dream grad school, and of c they couldn’t even pretend to be happy for me, and maybe i can finally escape this hellhole but i won’t be able to afford living out after paying the tuition fees … bc i’m still paying off my debt .. and it’s also a lot of money … i wish i could just stay at home but i think i’ll rly unalive myself if i continue to be here … i feel like i’ve ran out of options … i keep trying to find ways to help myself but i keep hitting walls and it’s making me lose hope … 

for awhile i’ve said, i wish i never existed, tht way my family wouldn’t have something to be disappointed by, it’ll make everyone’s life easier, most of all mine 🖤",1
not living for anyone else or myself,i really don’t know what to do i moved places recently to a new city from a small town to start living for myself … i was and now 2 months later i’m back in the same place i was a year ago… i lived in the small town march 21 until march 22 and my mental health was so low i couldn’t get out of bed couldn’t eat couldn’t do anything and i moved march 22 and it’s been 2 months and i’m back in square one when i first moved i loved it i was happy i was thinking things were going to get better but now i’m here not wanting to live and not living for anyone else i have lost 99% of my friends my family don’t contact me anymore i go to the gym to help but not even that works anymore i’m just in pain and exhausted mentally and physically… my note (if you catch my drift) started in march and the list of people who i say good bye too is getting longer… just more people to disappoint i guess… i can’t do it anymore i’m so tired… i’m an addict it was alcohol then drugs but now i get drug tested so i’m back to alcohol… help me please i’m so so so tired of living it’s exhausting,1

I have a mental disorder of depression and just want to end all,"Hello, first time posting here, sorry for my English btw, I don't write in English very often.

I'm a 27 yo male and I am totally depressed and I feel absolutely alone in life. I did move on to another city for work and I don't have any friends here, but in my other city didn't have so much friends neither. I have a depressive disorder and my self confidence is totally destroyed. Since I was a child my brother and people in high school destroyed my confidence. Later I closed myself in my room just playing video games and studying. I became a porn addict, when I was 18 I used to see girl and heterosexual pornography, but then bc every girl in my youth treated my like shit I turned to transsexual pornography and since then I have never stopped watching it.

I went to prostitutes 3 times and can't finish with girls. Also I had a girlfriend, my first kiss was with her at 25, but she disappeared from my life because his own personal problems (she is still a marvelous person, I'll never forget her). It is fair to say thwet I have a lovely mother that loves me a lot but she never couldn't be there bc of work and my father didn't show himself so much.

Now every time I go to a walk I arrive home totally destroyed bc I am absolutely lonely and can't do anything. Can't look or talk with girls bc I feel like I am a peace of shit that doesn't worth anything and even if I didn't think that I cannot stablish a normal relationship with any. My friends just are walking their own path and I respect that but only one of them knows about it and talk with me and helps me but he gets tired too.

idk. just tired.,"Early 30's. Male. I have good family and friends but I don't feel like I belong. I often find myself hanging out with them and wondering why they let me hang around. On the outside I'm all smiles and laughs. I could be laughing with them one minute, then feel completely alone the next. I feel like a disappointment. I have nothing going for me. I'm not someone anybody would be proud of. I know ending it all would be a burden on my family so thats out of the question. My mother passed recently and my father is up there in age. I'm going to hang around for as long as my father is here. After that, I want to move somewhere away from family/friends. I dont think my absence will be felt that much. I don't like being alone, but feeling alone in a crowd sucks too.",1
I just graduated but I’m not happy at all,"I just finished a surgical assisting program and passed my certification exam, which I was really worried about. I should be ecstatic and excited for my future career but I just feel empty. I live with my mom and she knows how tough this has been for me especially how difficult it’s been working with one of my instructors (who I nearly dropped out because of and got progressively more and more passive aggressive towards me which made me feel worse throughout the program).

On my last day of classes when I told my mom I finalized all my paperwork and finished everything her response was “good now I don’t have to hear about that teacher anymore.” Since then she’s been buying things for and talking about my niece’s 8th grade graduation and has said nothing of mine. When I found out I passed my certification exam she just told me good now you can get a job.

I’m not looking for validation and I don’t need to be put on a pedestal, but I feel like I’m being ignored. I’ve worked so hard, sacrificed my mental and physical health for this program the only person I live with won’t even interact with me. I feel like I accomplished nothing, all of this was for nothing.

I’m sorry for this pity party “oh poor me” but I’ve just never gotten any approval from my mother. It’s hard now that she’s the only one I’m around but I shouldn’t have expected anything more out of her. I just needed to get it out.

What if,"What if you want to change and need to change and you are trying to change, but its not working and nothing helps and you don't know how?  
 
Struggling and just barely holding on at times.  You start to push people you care about away because you don't want to drag them down anymore.

You try to hide in plain sight because how can you explain.  Go to therapy?  Right they tell you things, you hear them, you try and nothing.  get medicated?  Okay sure that helps... Maybe.

Smoke weed?  Yeah sure you feel better... for awhile.  Maybe you lose your job getting randomly tested.  Not to mention just how expensive it is to keep that up.

Alcohol?  Sure you are numb for awhile but keep that up for a few days and see how much worse you feel.

I am exhausted.",1
I don't wanna keep going anymore.,"My girlfriend was going to therapy, she was going through a lot, so one day I told her that I would give her some time so she could heal without feeling the pressure of not giving me the affective responsability that I deserved, so yeah, that happened. Few days after she went to me and said: ""hey, I'm meeting someone new, i really like this person"" and I felt so awful and empty at that point that my answer was ""hope everything's gonna work fine for you, i just need to say that I don't want to repeat this ever again"" and she said okay. You know why? Because a guy made her feel like shit before coming back to me, so i think she just used me like her toy that she could keep just in case, and btw, after that she told me that she didn't want me to go, she wanted to be friends, so I told her I wouldn't go but I needed my space, but now i don't know what to think about that. I put her feelings first, I didn't wanted to hurt her in all these years, I always tried to give her whatever she wanted, no matter what problems I had, she always was first to me. So, yeah, I've been dealing with a deep sadness almost half of my life, I went trough a lot too and at this point of my life I'm just so desperate to be in peace and not feeling anything at all, I want to disappear, not just for her, she was only my reason to keep going...

"I don't know what to do, the only thing I want is to die ...","I feel empty, with no reason to live ... It's the only thing I'm thinking about every second and that I want to die, nobody listens to me, they just tell their problems, but if I ask if I want to let off steam, nothing, sometimes they even laugh at me. I'm sick, I'm sick of it all, I want to end it, I just want it to stop, I feel that if I died, no one would be sorry for my death, I just feel like a big burden. it was better if I died a long time ago ... I am tired of false friends, I am tired of bullying, of people who betray you, of people who reject you, judge you, exploit you ... I really think I have to get it over with ... this whole situation is making me lose that little desire to live what I have left ..

Plese, if you have any advice on what to do, answer me in the comments. I sincerely thank you, sorry for the time I made you waste ...",1
Which supplement or stack helped you most with your Depression and/or Social Anxiety?,"I‘m 22, suffered from depression and social anxiety since I was 15. now also ADD like symptoms and anhedonia. Please no recommendation like go to therapy or get pharmaceutical medication route because I already tried over 13 meds of different classes (SSRI, SNRI, tricyclics, atypical, neuroleptic/antipsychotic, and even a MAOI called Moclobemide). I also went through 2 depth psychological therapies and 1 cognitive behavioral one. I also went to the gym every second day for almost a year. I also read many books (e.g. Dale Carnegie, Eckhart Tolle). Nothing helped.

I also know that substances are not the way out because one just masks the symptoms with them instead of rather healing them.

My actual antidepressant Mirtazapine does help me at least a little bit (I mean all the others did NOTHING): better appetite (always had a problem with underweight), better sleep (always had insomnia and sleep issues) and it reduces the amount and intensity of me slipping into the deepest holes of depression. Still iI does nothing for my Social Anxiety and I as well as my life still feel worthless most of the time. I still suffer a lot.

As I gave the med the usual time of months to show effects I started on Phenibut and Kratom again. I don‘t want to abuse Phenibut or Kratom anymore for this purpose as the first few days are great but they fuck me up even more. 

So do you have any positive experience or success with any supplements, nootropics or herbs for Depression & Social Anxiety? Social Anxiety is the biggest source of my depression (makes sense regarding its restrictions, just to name some: isolation, not going out, no movement, no light, no real friends, problems to find and keep a job, not visiting university, missing important life experiences and just canceling every invitation). That‘s why the socializing or socially anxiolytic part of the supp/nootropic/herb would be very important.

Maybe you know something that can help me out? I know Phenibut and Kratom already. Phenibut works amazingly but only 2 days and the rebound and withdrawal is hell. It‘s like exchanging 2 good days for 7 following bad days. Kratom is good for depression but doesn’t do anything for my Social Anxiety. It also has bad withdrawal.

I tried a lot already, the traditional way of medical route like talk therapy of both types, pharmaceutical medication of various types, going to the gym every second day (SURELY helpful, no placebo, but not enough to make life not feel like hell) and many many supplements. Until now I couldn‘t find anything really helpful except for Kava Kava, but it kills my appetite too much, makes my skin dry out very fast and costs too much for daily use.

I still wanted to give following herbs/supplements a try:
• Lemon Balm
• Skullcap
• Kanna (Zembrin)
• KSM-66 / Ashwagandha
• SAMe
• Bacopa
• Lions Mane 8:1 Extract
• Gotu Kola
• Polygala
• Tongkat Ali
• Passionflower Extract
• Valerian Extract
• Black Seed Oil
• Beta Alanine
• [any other one not listed here but experienced by you]

Maybe you have experience with any of the above ones or any other one and could tell me more about your experience with it.

Please give a rating like this:
1. 0-10 for Depression
2. 0-10 for Social Anxiety
…and tell me more about your experienced effects regarding…
a. Mood/depression
b. Social Anxiety/sociability/talkativeness
c. Drive/motivation
d. Cognition/attention/memory
e. Other positives
f. Other negatives (e.g. side effects)",1
I have plans,"So I have a plan. I’m going to finally end it all after going to GCP live in LA. I ordered something to help me and I just need another key item to help me. I can last another month. But the biggest question is, should I do a Facebook live and see if anyone watches me die? That’s really dramatic. I’ve never done anything “outspoken” like that.

I had this dream that I went live and my death would be seen by all. Until FB takes the video down of course. But at the same time, I should just do it quietly and don’t let anyone know until it’s too late.

I have another month to think about that. I doubt I can be talked out of doing it.",1
I'd rather be nothing,"My chemically imbalanced brain is doing that dance it does trying to grasp at endorphins and only grasping at straws. It must have had them in reach at one point in my life otherwise it wouldn't know the difference. They say without despair there is no happiness, so in turn if I just gave up on my dispute for happiness could I then get rid of this obsess of unhappiness? Feelings are over rated. Can I just sit here content and mute to the world? I'll watch the world turn like cars off my porch. 

Sometimes I'd rather be nothing. Just a cool breeze in the wind. Maybe I'll give you a shudder down your spine as a suddle reminder that there was once something there. But don't come looking for me, because I am not lost. I know where I am staring up at you from my pit of nothingness. Just throw some dying flowers on me and be on your way. There's not much to see here. I'm at peace. Whatever that is",1
I just really sometimes don’t want NOTHING,"Like nothing at all, like right now it’s hard for me to even text this, can anyone relate, I just feel I want to sleep, but I’m not sleepy at all, I just imagine taking a pill and finishing it all, just my feeling…",1

not a good day,"TW: a little bit of swearing, a bit of school drama, i just really needed to let this out cuz i dont think anyones listening to me anymore.

so i started highschool irl this year (i was in virtual last year). I'm generally a very people-centric person. By september, I had a really tight social circle (i was in the IB programme, which forced us all to stick together for the same classes) in which we all cared for each other. It was fun for a long while. I had a great best friend, good grades, and a dream life. By November I had peaked in my serotonin for the rest of the year, but by december it all started coming downhill, and if you read on you'll see why. I had a crush who i eventually asked out and she said yes. which was great cuz my friends were all being wingmans for this girl. She was really sweet and nice, and I thought this was the greatest. However, asking her out was the first step downhill. Now I have a generally strict mom, who forced me to spend a lot of my time on schoolwork, which was fine. However, I did love playing video games with the guys and I was a HUGE movie addict (I had watched more movies than the entire grade 10 year, even more than our CINEMA HEAD for the art committee). As much as I loved spending time with her, she was always looking to spend every last second I had with her. I was looking for a slow and steady relationship, and she was looking to go  for the dreamy high-school romance found in movies and what-not (it was later revealed to me that she was a bit boy-crazy and spent all her time dreaming about the perfect boys and complaining how I never lived up to that). I tried to spend time with her but I was also starting to feel the pressure of school and wanted to spend time by myself.

While many of you probably cant see anything majorly wrong so far, it started dropping very, very fast, and this might take a bit of effort to keep up. My best friend had started dating this one girl whom we were all friends with, and dropped her in 2 weeks. I gave him 0 flack for this (keep that in mind). He started to date a guy who was virtual, and dropped him in less than 24 hours. Once more, I gave him no flack, trusting him to do the right thing. Around february, just before our 2 month anniversary of getting together, I had gotten COVID. Now a good thing to note is that I was diabetic and therefore highly susceptible to viral diseases, and COVID was the worst thing that could happen to me. I had to stay home for 6 weeks, which while it may seem small in comparison to the dangers, it was 6 weeks that my friends started texting me less and less, 6 weeks where my gf grew apart, and 6 weeks where I was starting to feel very lonely. When I came back from christmas break, my best friend ran up to me, chest-bumped me, and gave me a bear hug, almost crying after just 2 short weeks away from eachother, even though we were texting a lot and had gone out to watch spooderman a week earlier. When I came back from a 6 week quarantine, he just looked at me, looked at my hair (which i had done up in braids) and said what the hell happened to you. No hi's, no welcome backs. It might be a little selfish of me, but it was a shock nonetheless.

By now i trust you can sense where this is going.

It just kept spiralling downwards. My grades had fallen substantially, my friends no longer talked to me the way they did before. By April, my best friend wouldn't even say hi to me, choosing a variety of snarky, sarcastic, toxic comments over any genuine friendliness. My gf broke up with me less than 2 weeks after this. And this is where we reach the climax.

2 weeks ago, our school had an early dismissal, which, by sheer coincidence, lined up with the opening of a new Cocos down the street. Since anime, sex, and bubble tea is all that a hs student cares about, the entire school went onto a frenzy as people ran down the street forming hours-long lines for some overpriced smoothies. I had left my phone in my class in a rush to get out (I was tired from the sudden arrival of heat) and told my friends that I wanted to go back and get it. My ex volunteered to go with me. FIRST RED FLAG. She was nice after the breakup but the tension was certainly there, I had apologized on 3 seperate occasions about the break up, and repeatedly asked if we could still stay friends. Why did she volunteer to come with me? I shrugged it off, constantly telling her it might take a while and she could just go back. When she didn't, I just played it off with my quirky attitude, playing off an old joke we made about towels. We returned back with my phone a little over an hour later, and in 10 minutes, i was on the bus ride home.

&#x200B;

And then i come to school the next day.

&#x200B;

Now, I don't know what I thought would happen. I was still really tired and my guard was lowered, but the minute i stepped into class i knew shit had gone down. First of all, my best friend straight up ignored me, my friends were all giving me curious eyes, and my ex looked piss. Fine, I said, it might just be a rough day, report cards had come out and IB students are notorious for crying over every last decimal of a percent. I leave class, earbuds in my ear, and walk away towards my next class. The next thing i know, my best friend is shoving me around, slapping the earbuds outta my ear, and yelling at me asking why I held her hand. I said wtf and he just responded with a threat saying hes never going to talk to me again. I did not know what had happened and texted the only rational member of our group, who said that my ex was complaining about me once more behind my back in a private gc with all my other friends, saying im being a dick and toying with her feelings, when truthfully I was just being myself (in my defense try making a conversation with your ex, by yourself, in an empty school, waiting for a long time). Now my friends were definetely more popular than me, so naturally everyone radiated towards their story without hearing mine, except for rational person and a good friend that was willing to listen to me rant ab how none of this was fair. Now none of them would talk to me, if i joined their vc they would all leave, if i asked to play with them theyd ignore me, and they blocked me on all their socials. I tried to apologize to each of them, but frankly i was dead to them for all they concerned. And for the first time in my life i felt so truly, truly alone, like everyone was out to get me and i could not make them listen. They called me many things over this time, with my best friend, the one who i thought i could trust and help me out on my bad days, calling me a pedo, even though I was in their grade and I only dated one girl in which once we broke off I asked just to be friends. I was a bit more open to hugs and stuff from my friends, and i guess they could have just asked for it to stop, but most of the people in my friend group do that too. They also blamed me for being jealous of the person i ranted to because they were good friends with my ex, when truthfully by that point i just regretted asking her out. Now i'm stuck writing a million apology letters to people who never respected me and turned their back on me on a moment's notice. Thats highschool i guess.",1
I don't trust myself anymore.,"I don't trust myself anymore. I'm 32 and am just finding out that I have adhd.

Now I have questions like ""who are you even?"" And statements like, ""look at the person you've pretended to be your whole life!"" I'm a fool for falling for my own deception. Turns out I've been lying to myself for so many years that I don't know what's what anymore.

Super easy meals?,"Ive been looking for easy and cheap meals for when you’re just a mess but honestly, they’re hard to find. And not so easy >.>

"""Everythings fine,"" I say with a polite smile","I fell into a black pit swallowing dark matter whole. Like a snake despair wraps around me and squeezes the air from my lungs.

Just pull me out of this quick sand, my eyes say. My poor eyes, self aware and living in this nightmare motionless and mute. And pleading. I soon sink to my knees, and my heart falls soon after.

I don't know how to function,"I'm (21 F) a college student and I'm dealing with depression and anxiety. I always get panic attacks and I cry the moment I have an alone time because that's the only thing I can do. I always wanted to die but I can't. Because even in death, I still think about people around me (especially my mom) & how they will be affected. Even in death, I still think of what burden the people around me will carry. I don't know how to function, I don't know how I can bring myself to do my responsibilities as a student when all I've been feeling are these commotion of emotions and clouded thoughts. I am so drained & exhausted, I have all these problems and they just keep piling up.

I'm a perfectionist and that sucks because even if I'm at my lowest I still can't bring myself to lower my expectations. Which leads me to my next point, expectations. People around me expect so much from me and I just want to make it stop, but I can't and it hurts. It's so hard to give my best when I'm not okay. My grades are high & I'm usually the leader when it comes to working as a group, people always ask for my help when it comes to academics, people always expect me to provide a great output because that's just how I deliver. But I can't handle it, I can't handle all these pressure. I don't know how. It's so hard to do something when I can't even find reasons for living.

Another problem I have is with relationships. People easily let go of me, ignore me and replace me. I don't know why. Even if I go through great lengths for that person & do my best to make sure they are well-taken care of. It's as if people only date me because of convenience. Is it because I'm ugly? Is that why guys I've dated don't take me seriously? I don't know what's wrong with me. I just don't. I feel like people only remember me or need me in their lives because I'm convenient for them. My friends always ask for help in academics & my classmates do the same, there was even a time when they said I can't get sick because they need me. I can't even put myself first. The moment I try to, guilt just consumes me, making me feel like I don't deserve a break. I don't deserve to take a rest because people are counting on me. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. No one even cares about me. Despite everything I do for everyone, no one asks me if I'm okay. No one comforts me. I am a wreck and it hurts. It hurts to be me.",1
therapy alternatives?,"So my girlfriend and one of my close friends found out I'm depressed and they want me to seek therapy, but the thing is I don't want to go to therapy.

Depressed 23 year old male,Hello I’m just typing out a drunk rant because nobody else truly cares to hear what I say so why not say it in here. From about 14 y/o to my senior year of highschool (age 18) I did nothing but spend every possible minute playing video games or watching videos on how to get better. From perfect summer weather to 1 foot of snow I just stayed inside and did just that. Fast forward to me about to be 24 still living at home working at a window factory with a dui and a gf of 5 years who’s cheated at least 1 that you know of. Now I work 2nd shift and just play more video games and drink heavily while doing it. I’m so depressed and unmotivated that doing the laundry gets pushed back weeks until I literally run out of clothes. Since the only thing that brings me any sort of happiness is video games that’s all I do and think about day in and day out. I am falling further and further behind and becoming more and more of a lazy pos somebody please help me find something that makes me enjoy life besides playing video games. I feel like it’s the only thing I’m good at and the only thing I can impress people in everywhere else in life I just suck,1
I realized that I hate myself and my problems are my own fault,"Sorry if this post gets too long but I feel like no one else will listen or care about my feelings or my problems. I guess I'll start where I think my self hatred started to form. In high school I was a very talented artist, I loved to draw and I would do it every day, it was the only thing I wanted to do and I couldn't really see myself working a 'regular' job. I really wanted to go to this art college in my city that was really hard to get into, and you needed to have an amazing portfolio. I worked really hard to try to get into the college and I did, with a decent scholarship at that too. I remember being very happy and proud, but soon I realized that even with the scholarship I would needed a crap ton of money. Long story short I couldn't go to the college that I wanted without taking out a very big loan and ended up going to a regular community college. I was miserable there, I felt like a failure for not going to the college I wanted to go to. I think this was the beginning of my depression, and after a wasted year of attending classes I didn't want to go to and staying in my dorm room by myself (I hadn't made any friends there) I decided to drop out. After laying around the house for a month my mom told me I had to get a job, even though I hated the idea of getting one, I got a job at a fastfood restaurant. At first I was only working part time, but then I my boss asked me if I could start working forty hours because they needed the help, and I agreed because I really didn't have anything better to do. And ever since then for about five years I feel like I've been stuck in this loop of going to work for eight hours going home feeling exhausted for like six days a week, and since I now had disposable income I would spend all my spare time playing video games and eating junk food. And it felt like over time I felt more miserable and I didn't know why, but every day I felt like something was consuming my head with negative feelings and thoughts. Then one day I had a really stressful day then hour work day, and when I got home I just broke down, i started sobbing in my bed for hours and i didn't know why i felt so horrible. The next day I left home and told my job and my family I was taking a vacation with a friend, but really I had just left to a nearby city and got a hotel for a couple of days to be alone.

Having time alone to myself for a while made me realize something, I hate myself. And all my problems are my own fault. I feel like I just suck, like the worst type of person and I hate to be left alone with my thoughts because when I am the negative thoughts in my head get stronger and I can't handle them, and I think that's why I spend so much time watching youtube and playing video games, because they distract me from my mind. I think it's why I hate trying to fall asleep, because that's also when all the thoughts and negative emotions start to infiltrate my mind the most, which is why my sleep schedule would mess up. When I figured out that I hate myself It almost felt like everything made sense, not only why I was miserable all the time, but also why I distanced myself from people, it's not because of them, it's me, who would wanna hang around me anyways? The reason I'm 23 year old virgin and never had a relationship before? Well why would anyone want to date me in the first place, let alone be near me? I'm always miserable, have no ambition, I'm awkward, and I'm just terrible to be around in general. What made me feel even more like trash was the fact that i found out my high school crush is a famous tik-tocer/ live streamer (if I told you who she was you'd probably know her) and is making more money in a year than I have in my five years of working my crappy job. And a friend from high school who was in my art classes has a video game coming out this year. Finding this out made me feel even more crappier than I already have been. Because I regret so many things I could have done, or have done better. It's one thing when you try and fail, atleast you can say that you tried, but when you never even gave yourself      a chance to try, then you have no one to blame but yourself. And I hate myself so much for that reason.

After I got back from ""vacation"" I went to my boss and told him to cut my hours down to 20 a week because I was too stressed out to continue working the way I had been. People at work started asking me why I cut my hours down, when I told them that I was just too stressed to work anymore and needed time to myself I nearly got laughed out the building. This isn't just at work either I've even tried to talk to some friends and my mom about my self hatred and depression, but it feels like no one takes me seriously, or says I have it easy and have no reason to be depressed. This is due to a couple of reasons 1) I live with my mom and don't pay any bills, rent or have any real big responsibilities. 2) People think I'm rich, lazy,  privileged and spoiled. I remember one time I was talking to some friends and I mentioned that I have a about $30,000 in my savings while working at my job for so long (which isn't a whole lot of money to me). Ever since then people have been spreading rumors around my neighborhood and at work that I'm rich and just horde my money. Basically no one thinks I have a reason to be depressed, or doesn't take me seriously. I'm always told by someone ""You, think you have it hard? You have the easiest life."" Then I proceed to get told all the reasons why the person I'm talking to has it harder than me: ""I have bills and rent to pay to pay, you don't. All you do is buy video games"" ""My bank account is in the negative and they're trying to take my car."" ""I have a kid to raise and another on the way. I have no free time to myself. How are you the one who is depressed here?"" It makes me feel like my problems don't matter because people have it worse then me, like I have no reason to be depressed, which makes me hate myself even more for feeling this way. I feel so alone, like I can only rely on myself, and having this feeling of self hatred makes it harder for me to rely on myself. Every day that passes feels like I'm just waiting for it to end and for the next one to begin. 

I've tried to help myself slowly by making adjustments to my life and trying to get back into drawing. But since I haven't drawn in while my skill level sucks. I hate looking at what I draw  because it looks like crap to me. If I took out my portfolio and old sketch books from years ago it would look like another person had drawn them. It makes me feels like crap having how far I've fallen from where I was. And when try to sit down and focus I can hear my own inner voice telling me that I suck and I should give up because I'll never be any better than use to be, and it cause me even more self hatred. My sleep has gotten a bit better, someone online recommended I try listening to asmr while trying to sleep, specifically of people whispering positive affirmations. This is something  that I feels helps me the most because I really want affection. It doesn't have to be sexual, but to have someone tell me that everything is gonna be ok and give me praise for my efforts means the world to me, even if it isn't real. It has helped in me not be consumed by my negative thoughts while trying to sleep. I'm going to keep trying to improve myself, there are days where I feel like doing absolutely nothing but staying in bed, some where I just wanna disappear, and some where I try to distract myself with mindless videos and video games that I have even started losing pleasure in playing. But I try to get a little done at least every day.

I’m 27 Been single for about 2 1/2 years,So I’ve been single for that long giving  my self time to heal from being in different toxic unhealthy  relationships  (I’ll spare the details)off and on for about 4+ years  i felt like I was finally ready I finally met this girl that just caught my eye and we started to talk went on some dates spent time together  and eventually she met my family on a whim  I have trust issues but I’m also a emophila(someone who falls in love  quickly usually with rapid romantic involvement) and some what of a hopeless romantic eventually said she’s not ready for a relationship  and wants to work on her self for personal reasons and it hit me pretty hard  I feel like barfing and my heart has been pounding I want her to be happy so I understand for that I have to let her go but it’s just hard and idk what to do or how to feel,1
Now I die.,"Everyday is the same with a little difference than yesterday. This morning, I realised I can't get rid or this pain in my limbs and this faint headache.
That silver lining between breathing and suffocating keeps thinning out and I more or less feel my lungs compress as if the air inside of them is disappearing.
The beating heart is losing its rhythm and with every beat, my veins burn a little more.
This sense of weight over my head making me dizzy while keeping me awake, as if warning me to not lose consciousness.
A sense of darkness, my eyes losing sight and my ears numbing themselves, deafening everything I hear and all the lights slowly fading away.
The gravity over my body becoming heavier with every minute passing by and my soul feeling darker, pitch black, as if something really dense, like an endless abyss.
This sense of horror and a look of near but too far death, envisioning my own demise. As if feeling myself break apart into segments being buried deeper in this dark pitch.
A very weird feeling of something pushing my body deeper and deeper almost making it disappear into nothingness and as soon as I gain my senses, this excruciating pain making me suffer all over again.",1
Nothing matters anymore.,"ill be a man forever I shouldn't even try to become a woman, ill never be a real one

I really need to cry but I can’t.,"I’m extremely depressed. I’m still getting over a failed relationship so romantically I’m extremely lonely, my life is going nowhere right now and I can’t do anything about it, I can never do anything right, I need therapy but I don’t have the guts to do it or talk to anyone. For so many reasons I really want to cry but I can’t. I cry pretty easy but I also have a tendency to bottle up my emotions until it overflows. I also don’t like crying infront of others as I don’t want to make them uncomfortable but I also want a shoulder to cry on.",1
Come On Eileen,"This is such a strange question and I swear I’m not trolling like this is genuinely a problem for me. Every time I hear the song Come On Eileen I just start to cry. Like uncontrollably start crying my eyes out. It happened a few months ago and I skipped the song, then one day my Spotify was playing in the car and it came on and I started to cry and then today I was sitting in a cafe with my friend, the song starts to play and within seconds I’m just sitting there crying. To the some come on Eileen. Why is this happening like I genuinely cannot work out why anybody would cry to come on Eileen it’s such an upbeat song I can understand a sad song but I just can’t wrap my head around this and I just don’t know where else to post this. I’ve suffered with depression for years now but I just don’t know I’m so confused as to why this song makes me cry.",1
Emotions,"I need someone too talk with, I feel like I will go crazy. I end killing my own dog because I did not watch him. I feel this pressure pounding on my emotions. I feel this angry but at sometimes my box that keeps me safe. I feel the need too rock myself until I never wake up. I don't know my emotions feel cold but I can't explain but feel the need too not leave but make myself understand and close my emotions away.",1
I don't want help,"I have some pretty serious unresolved issues with my family. Possible PTSD, not 100% though but that has very little to do with them. I basically never learned how to escape survival mode and I'm constantly on edge waiting for something bad to happen to me. I don't let people get close and I have absolutely zero motivation to get help or improve myself. I basically want to just go off on my own and start over. I've been told by several people that I need to get professional help. Therapy or meds, but I just don't want to. I'm not ready to face that pain.",1
A 24-year old who sees no hope about life in general.,"I am a 24-year-old engineering student who just gave his final college exam today and who is about to graduate with a low CGPA of 2.8. I wanted to pursue a master's degree abroad but I know I can't do that as my options will be really limited now. I won't even find a job in my country where already there is a scarcity of jobs relevant to my field and now that I have low grades, I'm even down the pipeline.

On a personal level, my girlfriend broke up with me more than two years ago and I am still not over her. She has now been married and moved on but I'm still stuck. She was my first ever partner and I imagined my whole life with her, but like my most of my dreams, it nipped in the bud.

Now I feel like a total failure. Failure as a student, a lover, and without a job and who will not even be likely to get a job in the near future. I have no particular skill to be proud of. Just an average guy with ADHD and a depressed lethargic mind. I have no enthusiasm to look forward to the next day, I hate waking up and leaving my house every day and I detest my very existence. I feel uhm how to put it, worthless. It feels so bad knowing that I am disappointing my loved ones who once had very high expectations of me but now, not so much. I am just tired and frustrated and confused thinking about my future. I formed a habit of taking sleeping pills and sleeping for 7-8 hours at a stretch as it is the only time when my mind isn't clouded with negative and intrusive thoughts. I am not anxious just apathetic. I find no motivation as I see no hope and no goal. I don't know what to do.

Don't know why I wrote all this here. Feel free to suggest, comment or judge or whatever you like. Guess I just wanted to vent that's all.",1
how to get over dissociated feeling when i forgot to take antidepressants for a day,"so i forgot to take my antidepressants (sertraline) yesterday and today i feel disgustingly dissociated and weak. i’ve read it’s considered as withdrawal symptom for missing a dose.
i’ve taken them irregularly lately (i remember to take them later than i usually do) and it’s been an unpleasant experience bc of that.

im just wondering if there’s a way of easing the feeling because i can’t even function when it happens.",1

Things go well but only for so long then I’m right back to being the disgusting person I fight so hard not to be. 
I am the cause of all my problems. 
If I didn’t open my mouth…. I wouldn’t have half of these problems. 
I don’t want to be here anymore I fall asleep almost every night writing different notes to my family or different preparations when I die. I am tired of spending every weekend sitting alone in the dark and every night crying myself to sleep. 

I just needed to complain and get this out because I am stuck being alive. Not for me but for my family and those who I know would be affected my dying. Or those who claim to anyways. Every night I sleep with a bottle of pills beside me in my dresser drawer waiting for one night when I can’t take it anymore.",1

idek,"TL;DR: Wake up, snooze. Wake up, go to work. Pay taxes, pay rent. Count pennies, stare at screens to escape reality. Cry on Reddit because you have nobody else, go to sleep. Repeat.

I don't even know why I'm writing this tbh. Was looking for painless ways to die and came across this subreddit, figured I might as well rant here since I have nobody I can really openly talk to about this topic.

I'll be graduating college soon in August after I finish out my minor. Only 3 years +2 summers for everything, with a full ride scholarship. It just makes me that much more ungrateful for even having thoughts about ending everything immediately after.

I have no direction from here. I spent the past half year trying to develop a business to provide some benefit to the world, but turns out the startup cost was way too high to really take the extreme risk. But fuck everything is more expensive these days. I spend my days working as a cog for Amazon, and with the hours they've been giving me, everything goes to rent gas and whatever other necessities.

My lease is up soon and new management will be increasing rent by $50 a month if I stay. Yay. More things I can't afford. The apartment isn't even that good, 550 sq feet and a studio apartment pretending to be a 1 bedroom. People yelling and ambulances going by every day. I'm just selling my soul to whatever work place so I can barely scrape by and live in a place I hate. 

The only thing I enjoy is playing games, escaping reality, but the more I play the more time is wasted and the more things pile up on the to do list. All I ever do is the to do list. I hate going out, my anxiety makes almost any social experience unenjoyable even if I put on a good outward experience. Combine that with no energy to ever do anything, it feels like I'm just dragging this chain and ball so that I can feed into the tax and corporate machines.

Hell, when I was exploring ways to die painlessly I was getting targeted ads for it. ""Need something to lift your spirits?"" Buy our product/service now! Hilarious.

The only time I've ever felt truly happy was on MDMA. Maybe occasionally on psychedelics too, but those are a wild card. I haven't done anything in a while because of time constraints and drug testing, but fuck for years the only thing I looked forward to was my semiannual Molly roll. 

I moved to the city I'm in now from a rural area for college, but I really made no friends in college. A few acquaintances, but nothing like I expected. Never got invited to any parties. Though I've learned to just blame the pandemic for that, even though it's definitely not the entire reason.

Of course, like anyone ever, I'd love to share real love with someone. Every relationship I've had I have had fleeting feelings, I always grew to find my partner more annoying. Maybe it's the people I was with, maybe it's me. 

I hate being a man sometimes, what I would give to have someone - anyone show interest first. If I even want a shot at feeling that way with someone, I have to initiate the idea. That means being rejected time and time again, and it's not like I'm unattractive, I've just always been the odd one and I think people pick up on that.

I think the only reason I'm still alive now is because of the unbearable pain my death would have on my mom. Everyone else would get over it eventually, but not her. Why does it seem that the only way I can find peace is by hurting who loves me most? You also can't shake the thought that you'll go to hell just for trying to escape it. Wouldn't that be funny if I left and ended up right back here.

Don't know what I'm expecting for posting this, but if you're reading this then thank you. It makes me feel like I exist, even if only through some text on a screen.",1
hate my life,So tired of being alive.  No one cares about me or loves me so whats the point. Everyone just treats me like a burden,1
"I’m almost 22 and have no friends, virgin, never talk to girls, depressed since age 17, and my housemates don’t like me and some just hate me","From the outside, people think I have a good life. I play D1 lacrosse so I was always around guys that are popular with good friend groups and good with girls. I could never relate to them, and I’ve always been viewed as weird. Lacrosse has always been my love, but I had to get 3 hip surgeries and a shoulder surgery within 2 years and miss my freshman and sophomore year which just made things worse. My father is an alcoholic who has scarred my childhood. I don’t have anyone to really talk to, I don’t like going to parties or anything as I’m extremely introverted. I have a lot of autistic tendencies. I am so awkward around girls. Being around people that’s social life and life with girls comes easy to them, it hurts even more. I remember the last time I was happy was my sophomore year of high school. I’ve seen 2 shrinks but nothing has gotten better. I live in a house with other lacrosse players and they just don’t like me, and 1 of them is just straight up so mean to me. I can’t say a thing around him without him being so mean to me. I once just broke down crying and sobbing in my room and everyone heard me and I told them I’ve been depressed for 4 years but that kid is just still an asshole to me. I’ve been trying to do a lot of self improvement and everything like meditation and cold showers. But I’m just so sad all the time. I know all of this was random and very unorganized but I just needed somewhere to open up",1
I’m finally going to ask for help tomorrow.,"My mental health has been rapidly deteriorating, especially over the last few months. I even planned to kill my self using poison I had bought online, and was against anti-depressants as I thought they would just confuse me to the point that I wouldn’t feel anything, including joy and sadness. However, after some thought, research, coming to terms that I might also be schizophrenic, I’m going to reach out to the NHS tomorrow via 111 and ask to schedule a appointment to see a physiatrist. I’m going to ask for medication to treat my depression, as well as support for schizophrenia, as well as ask for a evaluation as I suspect I might also have ADHD as well as being neurodivergent. I spoke to my mum previously about me getting tested for ADHD, but she out right said I wasn’t even though I was never tested and ADHD/ADD run in the family. Wish me luck, I’ll update on what happens.",1
Do Antidepressants generally change you as a person?,So today I just got prescribed antidepressants for the first time. I’m taking two different pills (ones and ssri n the other is generally used for anxiety) and I’m scared to start them. Ive been like this for so long it almost feels like a security blanket. I’ve kinda just come to understand what things trigger me and why I act the way I do. I’ve heard from a friend that when she was on them everything became dull and she didn’t feel like herself. I’m afraid that if I start them nothing will be exciting to me now and that I’ll change. What if I don’t like my boyfriend anymore? Or what if my friends think I’ve changed? What if the life I know now and the life I could be living are drastically different and I can’t handle it? I know everything in life is so exciting and nice sometimes BECAUSE I’m depressed and the highs are really nice but I can’t deal with the lows anymore. Essentially I’m afraid that if I take these pills I’ll become a shell of the person I was before and I think I’d rather deal with my depression n anxiety than to not find anything worth living for. So if you’ve taken them or are on them do you notice any differences?,1
So tired,"Everything is ****ed up. My collage exams are ****ed up, I dont have money in my pocket my friends are ****ed up. Grow up without love from my parents. They never support me from anything. I am really tired. I dont even show any emotion to anyone. Today I tried the cry but I can’t even cry. Only little bit tear come up from my eyes. Even my breath didnt change. Just callous cold face without any gesture. Also no luck from love. I just wanna put a gun under my chin and pull the trigger. This is not my world. I cant take it anymore. Nothing positive happening. I have no one. Just few online friends. But I dont wanna show my emotions to them. There is no where to go so I decide to write my feelings here. I wish I could suicide. I dont even think people will miss me. Just one week they will pity me after that they will forget everything about me. I swear death is calling me I can feel inside, on my skin. Like very cold hands touching gentle on my skin, my neck my arms.",1
Leaning towards suicide.,"I apologize to anyone who might not have wanted to hear this, but this is what I have decided to do. I’m an atheist, and believe I go nowhere when I die. The way I see it is that the day of my death will come one day anyway, why not now? “It will hurt you family!”, well yes it certainly will, but something you might not understand is that their pain will go away, mine will not. Besides, one day, they will all be dead too, so whether I live or die, it does not matter. Nothing anyone ever does or has done matters in the grand scheme of things because we are all going to die. Optimistic, I know.

I don’t want this pain anymore, and I see suicide as the only solution.",1

I'm a hypocritical lonely 28m & I honestly want to kill myself.," I keep posting here to vent, thank you for the space but even on reddit it's not safe.
I tell people to have hope, yet I have none and it hurts somuch,  I'm a hypocrite! I care for others but not myself and I feel as others don't care for me! 


I'm lonely in every sense.
I'm jealous of everybody.
I'm a nobody.
My future looks do bleak matter of fact I don't see a future...


Death would solve my problems but I'd cause more for everybody else, I can't even be free in death. Life is painful and nobody loves me, I'd say more but cannot deal with the negativity from other people who do not understand even if they have depression.


I'm too much of a coward to kill myself this life is torture. I won't get married, I won't even love myself above all, or have a career or skill and I'll be fat, stupid,slow,unfocused,jealous, full of self hate and I hate everybody, lonely, unwanted, consistently walked over and  poor.

They’re all very good close friends. Hardly anyone even says hello when I walk in. They all talk about going for drinks and I don’t get invited. I know it’s my first week but I have such lonely days. I got home everyday last week and cried. I feel so lost and lonely, I hardly have any money and I’m In debt. I just don’t know what to do anymore :( I don’t fit in anywhere it feels.

My best friend asked if I was okay and I said ‘no’ she made a joke about if I would feel better if she won a game then we played 8 ball.

🤷🏾‍♂️,So I’m the past my depression felt like a deep pit I thought I could never get out of .

My therapist says I should leave it alone but it’s really all I’ve known .,1
Does anyone just feel so alone when they know they have people they can go to?,"Do you know how exhausting it is feeling like you have no one in your life you can truly talk to? I hate to admit it but for years I’ve just been scared of being alone. So fucking scared. I’ve surrounded myself with people who don’t care about me, because of this fear, and then I criticize them for wanting to be around people bad for them. The friends I have now I don’t really care for. I have nothing in common with them and every time I try to explain that to anyone they just give me the “you have to TRY to get closer to them”. I have one friend who actually understands but I never talk to them. I just feel so alone now. When I’m not texting someone or preoccupied with something I just sit here and cry. Even when I was super depressed I didn’t do that. I find it harder and harder to fall asleep everyday. I can barely take naps anymore I just sit there turning over and over again. I feel like if I act any different in front of anyone I’m going to get questioned by them. That’s the last thing I want I honestly just either want to be listened to with no backlash or to be left alone. No in between. I feel like I have to act cool and fine everyday when I seriously just come home and think about what would happen if I just killed myself. I don’t think I could ever do it tho. Just thoughts obviously. Anytime I text someone about how I feel without thinking about it, I then get bombarded with questions which I didn’t want in the first place… I just wanted someone to know how I was feeling. I hate questions tbh I hate advice. I fucking know what I’m doing wrong don’t tell me what I already know. I just want someone to sit there and listen. I wish I had an online friend that would not judge me because they know me in person. Just someone who would sit and listen to me and I could do the same for them…yk?",1
Depression Post,"hello world, I am accepting the fact that my depression may be perpetual and that there is nothing that I can do to get rid of it fully. I am nothing but a spec a dust in the eyes of the universe. this world was never meant for me, I do not belong here. I hope I don't have to live the rest of the days of my life in misery but for now, this will have to do. I have bpd traits so I have to remind myself to not think suicide is the solution to every problem. I also tend to self harm when I am frustrated. I hate this world and everyone in it but I will try my best to pretend like I don't. for the sake of everyone's comfort❤️",1
I don’t feel like I’m made for living,"Everything takes so much thought, even the little things. What you say to people, how you interact, how to manage your day, everything you need or have to do.

I want to live but I don’t think my will to will ever come back fully. 

I’m so seriously tired and I just feel like I’m not cut out to experience life. Everything feels so unnatural and a struggle. I wake up everyday and feel drained at the thought of yet another day living. I feel so sad that that’s my first thought but it is and I seriously don’t know how I’m going to keep doing this.",1
Honestly I’m so confused on whats going on with me,"My dad acts like an asshole when he feels like it. I have this deep feeling in my stomach like how it feels when a parent tells you they’re disappointed in you. It’s not exactly like that but that’s the jist of how it feels. It’s like guilt dragging me down. I big reason I’m having the guilt is because this one time I had online school and I told my dad and he didn’t believe me. I did all these things to prove to him that I didn’t lie and he still punished me. It’s not that much it’s just the fact that he believes I lied to him. He made me a horrible little sit in child hood but I can’t help but still rely on his thoughts on me. I feel stuck in one place that I can’t get out of. Like a prison, a cell with the door open but the guard is standing right in front of it promising to beat your ass if you get near him. That’s about the best metaphor I can make for the situation I’m in. In truth, I’d run away if I didn’t have my sisters, I would try to start a new life somewhere like Canada. But my sisters are here and I feel I have to at least somehow pay attention to how they feel at almost all times a day I feel like I’ve failed as a person. In truth I wish someone who truly known me would tell me that it’s not my fault. I blame myself for everything my dad does because he uses me as a blaming punching bag. I may not be abused but I sure as hell wish I didn’t feel this way. 

Thank you for reading of you got this far. Any comments help.",1

I'm a loser and I brought a child into this world with nothing to support them. I'm glad my fiance supports me in this but I don't know how she can do that. I'm an absolute piece of shit for doing this to a child and I don't know if I'll ever let this down.

So tired of my mind killing me slowly....,"All i can think of everyday is ""shit im gonna be out of weed soon"" Truly, weed helps my anxiety and depression in amazing ways but at the same time having the thought of im gonna run out of the one thing that lets me escape for a bit makes me feel hopeless, on top of that i feel like a piece of shit everytime i ask one of my family members for money to buy weed but thankfully most of them understand that the weed helps me alot so most of time they give me money without conflict, in my mind i would love to have a job to pay for things myself but how can i work when 1. I hate myself 2. My mind cannot handle alot of people 3. I need weed throughout the day to actually feel normal for a bit 4. Im 22 and im a virgin so that just adds on and makes me feel like im not a man, i feel like im just a failure. My life is hard but it could always be worse so maybe if i remember that there might be a flicker of light left in my soul although i feel nothing, i care about nothing, i sit and almost drown in this shit everyday...

do you allow your boyfriend to look at other women?,so my boyfriend and I were at dinner and I noticed that he kept staring at one of the servers. and he kept saying that he thinks he used to work with her but it's pretty obvious that he was looking at her like that.  I noticed he does it pretty often. he said it was just a viewing the menu but as long as you don't order from it you're okay. and I told him no that's not how it is. if I looked at another guy and was saying how good he looks or whatever he would feel offended. it's like I told him why would you have to look at another female if you were happy with what you already have. he doesn't see anything wrong with it so I'm asking y'all what do you think. do you think it's okay for your man/ woman to look at another man or woman in that way as long as they don't do anything physically?,1

Today is Mother’s Day, and my dad keeps pressuring me to call my mom and wish her a happy Mother’s Day, even though he knows how badly she ruined my mental health. 
I feel like because I don’t cut, and I haven’t attempted suicide since I moved, that no one actually takes me seriously anymore, if they ever did in the first place. That if I just started self-harming, or if I failed in killing myself, then they’d understand that I’m struggling. But right now it just feels like no one cares. No one knows how frequently I try to plan my own death, but I feel like they wouldn’t believe me or wouldn’t care even if I told them.

UPDATE: I broke down crying because my dad kept pressuring me to call my mom, and now he’s furious at me. He came to my door demanding to know why I was upset, even though he knows my history with her. What am I not getting? Why does no one understand?",1
No one will love you if you’re unattractive.,"I want to be okay with the fact that I’ll never find love. Every says just love yourself. But self love doesn’t replace receiving affection. Self love doesn’t make you less alone. Humans are naturally social beings. It’s not unreasonable that I want to be loved. Also seeing everyone else I know be desired in ways that I’m not really really sucks. Everyone I know can download an app and find a bunch of people who are into them, but then when I do it no one wants me. Everyone I know can just go to a party and find a random person to make out with or hookup with. But I can’t do that. I’m so fat that everyone is disgusted by me and no one wants to touch me. I hate it so much. I wish I was dead.",1
I'm falling into a dark hole once again,"My depression has been coming and going throughout many, many years. Last year, I was getting better..or at least, I thought I was. I was happier, laughing a lot more than I thought possible, going out and hanging out with friends more often...life couldn't be any better. That is, until this year begun. At the start of 2022, my happiness has been going downhill. Nothing too specific has happened to cause this decrease of my mental health, it just...hit me. In my recent days, I've found it a bit more difficult to be able to find it in me to laugh, even smile. When I'm with my friends, Im not as talkative, I get irritated and snap at people easier (which I get flooded with guilt as the end result). I'm doubting if anyone even cares for me, I'm questioning if anyone would even attend my funeral when I die. I'm just overthinking and overthinking...I lost pleasure in many activities, I rarely have energy to do anything. I just wish this all would go away and for good, not just periodically. I just want to be truly happy without falling into a mental slump over and over again.",1
I don’t know what to do anymore,"I feel like I have no one. My mom is in love with my stepdad and she chooses him over me each time. He managed to ruin me and my mom’s tight bond by controlling my life. He threatens me (he used to throw and chase knives at me he has also threatened to do something to me many times)and he is just very rude and annoying to me. I don’t know if I want to kill him or kill myself anymore. My mom is constantly crying over him but she’s always like “I’m in love with him and he’s very sweet” and I’m thinking “You’re in love with the same man that hates your child’s guts, has cheated on you multiple times,he’s bipolar and won’t get help ,and he is rude to everyone but you do you mom”. Today is Mother’s Day and I didn’t get or do anything for my mom because I wish she wasn’t my mom and she doesn’t deserve to even be a mom. Sometimes I wonder if I did kill myself would she really care. My stepdad keeps nagging me about getting a job even though I’m only 15 and I’m not finna work at no Ice Cream Shop for 2 bucks an hour. I also literally turn 16 in a couple of weeks so then I can get a job anywhere but he won’t stop asking me about it. He said he’s gonna kick me out if I don’t work where he wants me to work (he wants me to work at a Pizza place or Ice Cream shop so his fatass can get ice cream every day). I wanna work somewhere with actual good pay and somewhere I’ll actually enjoy. My mom didn’t care that he threatened to kick me out she’s just like “Well you’re gonna have to get a ride to work somehow and I’m not driving you”. Also his daughters literally call him everyday asking for money and they have no job yet he says nothing. He is the reason I had seizures(epilepsy). He is the reason I have depression and anxiety. He is the reason I have tried to kill myself. He is the reason for every negative in my life. I’d rather live with my dad but the man is an alcoholic. I’m about to graduate anyways so I only have a couple of years left but I know once I go to college it might even get worse. I’m so tired of my stepdad he ruined my entire life everything in this essay isn’t even half of what he has done to me.",1
"Why can two people, who don't care, make a child and let her live life alone but it's not okay for her to not want to be here when she didn't choose to be.","My mum and dad popped me out and decided that they just don't care enough about me so I'm out in the world on my own. 

I go ahead and try to find my ""team"" because my family team doesn't care to have me part of theirs. So I find someone who fits everything. My absolute favourite person in the world and then they leave too after promising the world.

I do have abandonment issues but I tend to manage them pretty well these days, until the person leaves and I'm a spiraling mess of a human. Today being the worst. Being very unkind to myself and inconsolably crying whilst driving and screaming at myself until I can't hear. 

Why is this fair? And why am I not allowed to think that I don't want to be in this world. Though the people who put me here haven't made it easy for me and also couldn't care if I was in the world anyway. 

Will I have to carry on forever being dropped by the people I love? Or do I just give up now?",1
I'm suppressing being trans and it's taking a toll on my mental health,"throwaway account cause yeh..

So I'm a 18 year old ''female'' Since I was about 10 I knew i was ''different'' I had feelings for girls, boys, anybody but my body didn't feel right. When I was 13 i cut off my long hair into a short ''boy-haircut'' which I let grow a bit into just to my jawline before chopping it all off again. I was happy, I felt great, identified as a boy and I'm not sure why but when I was 16 I let my hair grow out again, I started wearing makeup and feminine clothes. In a way I think it was because people talked the idea ''You can't be trans cause you used to love princess dresses and pink'' into my head so much that I started doubting myself.

I been dating a boy for about a year now, I have shoulder length feminine hair and don't correct anybody on using she/her pronounce but it feel so off. I look at my bf and want to love him the way a boy loves a boy hold him like a boy holds a boy kiss him like a boy kisses a boy, I recently watched the serie ''heartstopper'' and it made me burst out in tears knowing I will never be able to love a boy like a boy loves a boy because nobody believes that I feel this way about my body and gender and my bf is a straight male that would not stay with me if I come out of the closet...",1
Girlfriend left me. She was the only thing in the entire world that brought me even a shred of happiness.,I am going to commit suicide. Before her I was in the worst depression of my life. She helped lift me out of it and I started seeing the light again. Now that she’s gone I’ve immediately gone back into that horrible depression. I will not live like this again. I will die soon.

Trying to clean the house for my mom while she’s out of town,"Had a bad day at work my friend couldn’t make time for me on my break. So I spammed them with calls when I got home to try to have someone to talk to, was feeling very depressed and it was minor inconvenience after minor inconvenience and I was like I don’t wanna be alive anymore and I told them that all they said was “stop” and I was like no I’m fr and they more or less kept going “hmm” and then they told me more or less “ don’t you gotta clean “ like more or less pushed me away when I’ve been there for them to vent for the past month. Then they expect an apology from me and telling me to never talk to them again. Don’t know what to do",1
I dont know where to post this,"Im not officially diagnosed as depressed and i don't want to say that i am but feel so sad and tired all the time and i just want a place where i can say these things. I have a really unhealthy relationship with most everyone. 

My own family takes advantage of my passive nature. They take my money and pressure me into giving up things and opportunities. I was accepted into the graduate studies at the top university in Canada and my mom pressured me to stay home because id have to move an hour away. 

I feel sad because this is the second time that happened- i was going to do my undergrad fully funded in Toronto but my mom again pressured me to stay. I feel so sad and helpless. when i stand up to my parents everyone tells me I'm being the crazy one and beats me down. My sister pisses me off the most. she does what she wants but i cant and it kills me. I feel so helpless, i don't want to exist. I'm so pathetic 

i became friends with a boy recently and because I've never had a male friend before I really don't know whats normal. I feel like most the things we do is abnormal. ( stay at his apartment from morning to night, constantly going out for dinner, always talking on the phone and zooming) he's pressuring me to move in with him and its bothering me. Im always trying to voice myself but he accuses me of treating him like my boyfriend when I'm really just trying to please him. I cant handle it when he yells at me. i don't like him i just want someone to listen to me and he's the only one that does 

I SOUND SO PATHETIC IM SO FREAKING PATHETIC AND POWERLESS I HATE MYSELF I HATE MYSELF 

i don't what to be the victim i don't want you to think I'm the victim I just don't know what to do, i wish i was someone else. someone who had self-respect and dignity who wasn't afraid of others or being alone. I want to stop existing i wish i never existed

Every single day I think about how the day will go when I finally decide I can't take it anymore.,"I work a job that I can't stand. Every day I deliver packages to the super rich in their nice giant mansions, not having a single fuck to give in the world.. But I can deal with that, a constant daily reminder of what I'll never have. That is fine. But what I absolutely cannot take for much longer is the absolute fucking misery of loneliness I feel every waking second of every day. For over 3 years now I have gone on tinder and swiped right on every single person, today I literally ran out of people. I have liked every single person on tinder in the greater Sacramento area and have never had a match. So when the day comes, I will take out the picture of the one ex gf of mine that I have never stopped loving that I've carried in my wallet for over 10 years. I will let her know about it, let her know that I'm happy about the way her life turned out, married to a military man, became a vet tech, and also competes in body building competitions. I will apologize to her for the hell I put her through as the heroin addict I was when we were together. And I will proceed to finish myself off with that very vice that I put her through that hell with. My only concern and the only reason this hasn't already happened is that I have a daughter who is an absolute daddies girl. The LITERAL one and only thing keeping me on this Earth is the thoughts of what she would go through if I were to be suddenly gone from her life. Lets hope that reasoning will last. I will continue to go on in this misery simply for her sake alone.",1
Idk what to do anymore,"I feel like I don’t have any REAL friends, everyone seems like they are cool with me but as soon as I wanna hang out or something they all say they’ve got things to do, I never get invited to party’s, I lost contact to a girl because I was too anxious, I just don’t know what to do anymore, I started smoking again, I’m failing most of my classes.

No one can ever understand,"Mental health ""professionals"" do not have any idea what it looks like.

There is no way true defeatism can be defeated.

Therapy can never work if you are the weakest link. It can never work if you fail every single time. If there is nothing inside you. It can work for sane people, going through bad times, but it cannot work for the defective.
Yes, no two people are the same. Everyone is an original. This means everyone can suck at different things. Some, though, do not suck at anything, while others have genuinely no positive value.

The mask fails me now,"We Wear the Mask

BY PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR

We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
And mouth with myriad subtleties.

Why should the world be over-wise,
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while
       We wear the mask.

We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
But let the world dream otherwise,
       We wear the mask!",1
How I feel,"The Mother's Son
- By Rudyard Kipling

I have a dream -- a dreadful dream --
  A dream that is never done.
I watch a man go out of his mind,
  And he is My Mother's Son.

They pushed him into a Mental Home,
  And that is like the grave:
For they do not let you sleep upstairs,
  And you aren't allowed to shave.

And it was not disease or crime
  Which got him landed there,
But because They laid on My Mother's Son
  More than a man could bear.

What with noise, and fear of death,
  Waking, and wounds and cold,
They filled the Cup for My Mother's Son
  Fuller than it could hold.

They broke his body and his mind
  And yet They made him live,
And They asked more of My Mother's Son
  Than any man could give.

For, just because he had not died,
  Nor been discharged nor sick,
They dragged it out with My Mother's Son
  Longer than he could stick....

And no one knows when he'll get well --
  So, there he'll have to be:
 And, 'spite of the beard in the looking-glass,
   I know that man is me!",1
Has anyone else ever felt like they’ve lost their sense of urgency?,"Since middle school, my life has been following the same pattern. I neglect all of my responsibilities until I end up with an overwhelming amount of tasks. I enter an anxiety induced frozen state because of the number of things I need to do and how impossible it feels. Then, it gets down to the wire, and I miraculously pull myself together and get everything done at the last minute. 

However, I’m in college now, and I’ve slowly found myself having more and more trouble moving past the frozen state. I’m at a point where I genuinely might not even have enough time to do the things that I need to do, and yet I’m still frozen. 

What’s wrong with me? How do I get out of this?",1
Having a rough day,"I’m currently sick (at least I think I am). My mom says it’s just allergy season but I feel sick. It’s been a rough few months. My grandma was found on the sidewalk in the snow (it snowed in April in my state for some reason ;-;) and had to go to the hospital. That same day my godfather had to go to the hospital. 

 That man is my idol and like the grandpa I never had. He was there for a few days and was released. Now he’s neglecting his hygiene and has not motivation to do anything and both my parents are drained. My date plans with my bf have been delayed so many times. Now my mom wants me to go into work and I work in a restaurant so I don’t wanna go to get anyone sick. 

 My bf and other friend were busy yesterday and don’t seem interested in talking to me today. They’re busy today too. I’m starting to doubt myself and think I’m just a bother to them. I hate myself and don’t wanna talk about it because I hate feeling like I am an attention hog. I feel really anxious. My stomach is starting to knot up and I feel like throwing up. 

 At least I have my bird to keep me company",1
My girlfriend and I of 10 months broke up like 6 days ago. What’s next ?,So my girlfriend and I broke up 6 days ago. We dated about 10 months ish. During the relationships we had alot of great times together and romantic moments. Spent a lot of time together. She said I was a great boyfriend and she really loved me. The issue she has with me is sometimes I am defensive and feel attacked I gues when she explains to me how she feels. I don’t always realize I’m doing this I just feel I have to explain myself . She says I do not approach situations calmly and get aggressive even when I don’t yell. I personally don’t think I’m that bad but I told her I was willing to work on it since she feels that way. We had many fights in the relationship and sometimes would result in days without talking. She’s always been honest in the relationship. The last fight we had was a couple weeks ago. But the communication stopped last Friday a bout a week a a couple days. We weren’t on the best note but I was trying to work it out but she told me she honestly does not believe anything will change. That’s what the text been like last few days I tried to give her some space to cool down. But 6 days ago I call her a few times no answer get left ok read and I see I’m blocked so I text her on ig and tell her I miss her and I promise I’ll work on myself and I still wanna be with her. And I told her we are still together. She replied she’s good. I asked good on what. She said good on this. I said we are still together. She said no. I said we aren’t together anymore? She said no stop calling me. I got blocked on ig a couple days later I guess because I was posting things to get her attention. We work together. First couple days I took the break up well and I wrote her a long ass thank you note by hand and told her best of luck and thanks for everything etc. But the next day my friend told me she said she’s done fr and is fw with someone else . That mad me made so I called her on another number but eventually got blocked went up to her at work and asked to talk but she keeps telling me she does not want to. Now I’m broken down. I miss her . I feel she’ll come back she’s just really mad and upset right now. Idk what to do. I know we are ment for each other. Sometimes I guess I just get defensive about certain things. I did a lot for her and we been thru a lot. I feel she also has a lot of personal issues she wants me responsible for but when I don’t respond the way I guess she wants I’m “defensive”. We broke up once like 5 months ago for about a week but I wasn’t blocked. She came back when she saw me move on with another girl. She broke down and tried to work it out. That break up made our relationship much stronger and I genuinely improved on things she wanted me to. I love her so much please don’t tell me it’s over and move on and she’s never coming back because I don’t wanna hear that . My goal is to not contact her or anything and just wait to see if she comes back. I can’t imagine everything we did together she just never talks to me again in life. 10 months of us cant be replaced by her talking to a guy for a few days . I’m so depressed I’ll still see her at work. She is just tired of having the same conversation every month and explaining the same thing over and over and Dosent think anything will change. I still feel she is just really upset and angry with me and will eventually miss me. I don’t see how we can be so good and happy 2 weeks ago but then 2 weeks of not being good with each other never speaking to each other again in life .,1
i miss my grandpa so much...," thank you for this... ive just been thinking abt life my grandpas currently in hospital bc he had corona and brain surgery and tho..... today i visited him he said ""who are you?"" that melted my heart so bad i couldnt do anything but to cry.. we had so many good memories and i was his bestfriend i was the one who visited him every 3 days and being with him, If i lose him i have nothing to do with my life. thanks for listening:(",1
Do you ever feel that your friends out grew you?,"You know I think about this day to day but I think my friends outgrew me? Like an imaginary friend I feel like I was left behind. I can't be myself around them in fear of ""offending them"" or interacting with them in the wrong way. It's like constantly walking on egg shells. I grew up in the early 2000s and compared to now that mindset is unbelievably  different. But i know how to act in society and the public eye but infront of my friends I feel like I should be able to be me without feeling the way I do. 

And sure they've reached out before but I feel like I shouldn't have to change to meet there standards I don't want them to change to meet mine either I just kinda don't know what to do. I feel like talking to then is impossible and it's fair that it is because tbh I'm not a Saint. If PCness had osha I would be violating all osha for comedy. I know I'm not in the right if anything I'm probably in the wrong but I feel like dynamically changing who you are how you talk to make others feel comfortable at the expense of your own comfort isn't right either.

I hoped during that time i could win her over again.. breakfast in bed and dinners.. but it just got worse since i could see that look on her face more and more.. i asked her about it.. she said we will talk... a few days pass and i couldnt wait.. it was killing me inside.. my heart was breaking more and more.... she told me she she just wanted to be on her own... and that i did nothing wrong... i am just shattered and broken... i packed my things and left... i feel im getting to old... ill never find someone that wants to cuddle on a couch and watch a movie.. who would want to go out for walks or just be with me for me .. .. i just feel defeated and broken.. with no will ..,1
I don't like pretending.,"I feel like society pressures us to put on a face to protect our pride and ego. None of us are allowed to truly express how we feel. But I don't like pretending. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of everything.

Life has always been a struggle and continues to be a struggle. Nothing ever goes right. Everything that happens in my life is just another obstacle I'm told to brave through. ""Keep a straight face."" Oh, the fake smiles I've mustered... have faded over time.

I feel like I've just been pretending. Telling myself I enjoy my life was a good, useful lie while it lasted. The illusions are being broken now. I don't enjoy living.

I don’t matter.,"Why is it always me? 

Has anyone ever asked themselves that before?

That silly question that you ask yourself when life throws you yet another curve ball and again, you have to find your way to collect the ball.

The ball is gone, it’s out of your control - out of your view…until you see the ball. It’s so far away but yet close and out of reach.

You do your best to reach for the ball but no luck whatsoever. 

Why is that?

Why can’t I get the ball? Why is it always running away from me?

Is it because of my morality? 

It is because I lack the emotional depth to feel the ball?

Lack the mental capacity to collect it? 

Or maybe I just lacked the awareness to see what people see in me…

And that’s…

I don't know what to do,"I feel stuck. I moved back in with my parents because I used up my savings while being stuck in my bed and painfully unable to take care of myself or get a job. They've been throwing out hints about me applying to jobs and building up my savings and preparing for any financial problems in the future and it's already been months but I'm stuck.

 Every time they mention a job, I get overwhelmed with anxiety and then end up hating myself for being so weak and think back to my want to not be alive. Its not their fault and they SHOULD be encouraging me to work since I'm an adult now and I'm living on their dime, but I just can't. I feel like such a burden all the time but I get panic attacks any time I even try to start applying for places that I end up breaking down and getting stuck in this loop of knowing that I'm a burden but that I can't do anything about it. 

I don't want to build a future for myself because I don't want a future. I don't feel the motivation to save myself at this point and I've just been dissociating to avoid the want to not be alive, but every time I get pulled into reality, it becomes overwhelming. It immediately makes me realize that I'm at the end of my rope and I feel helpless. I know that me dying would destroy the people around me but I don't know what else to do. I can't fix my financial problems on my own and my family can't afford to keep paying for me. I'm at the end and I don't know what to do and I do.

I keep looking for signs from anything or anyone,"The weeks leading up to me making the biggest decision of the year so far I kept flipping a coin to help me decide. Heads meant I had to go through with it, tails meant everything stayed the same. 

I flipped a real coin, I kept getting heads. I asked siri to flip a coin, I kept getting heads. I asked google to flip a coin, I kept getting heads. I must've flipped a coin 30 times and throughout all of it, I only got around 5 tails. 

I don't usually believe in the metaphysical or in superstition or anything like that but I thought this was an actual sign to go through with things so I did. I expressed my feelings to my best friend, I quit my job and hoped for the best. The day I went through with it, everything went to shit. I'm still unemployed and my best friend no longer talks to me. As the last nail in the coffin, I found out she was taken too.

Even after this, I still keep looking for signs. I see people driving the exact same car as her all around town. I see wire rimmed glasses and girls with red hair everywhere. As soon as I was beginning to forget her, a song came on with her name as the title and I keep thinking these are all signs of something to come. 

I hate feeling so dependent on these little ""signs."" I don't know if I just want to forget her or be with her.",1
I Finally Understand Depression,".....i used to think depression was some made up bullshit made popular by idiots who paid a lot of money to buy a piece of paper to display on their office wall. 

Im no weak individual by any means trust. I pride myself in the fact that no matter the discipline, conditions, or any other criteria, you will have to watch out for me. Im not conceided, billy badass or fake whatsoever. I simply have invested my time, my LIFE, to learning and training. 

Slowly, piece by piece, my life slipped out of my control. I was neglegent that i had lost control. 

""Whats the point off being able to do anything or know everything if you are not given a chance.""

The details of my life are not important. Whats important is that the only person who genuinely showed me that i meant something to them was an ex's 10 yr old son who asked me to come back again tomorrow after he gets off of school. He said that he likes it when i come over.

It was a blessing and a curse. 


Stay Strong My Friends

-DifficultBadge0-",1
Autistically Alone,"Old, Alone and ugly
So, at least I feel it. 
I know I look it. 
I know they see it.

No, I’m not asking for friends. 
I’d like a partner who understands.
I’ve asked the gods to lesson the tension;
Losing hair from stresses of exes.

This pain cycle has me contended. 
My back aches, and so I grow weaker.
I eat more to fill the gaps.
I sleep less, so the body reacts.

The retired boxer, my heart stills.
Head in my hands, at a table for two,
In this underground cell..
Still waiting for who?

Relapse to depression, or fight these dimensions?
I must fight. I must, I think.
I tell myself, I must do what certainly cannot be done on its own. 

It’s a tangible grasp, but my fingers are tied.
Tired, I’m slipping. I need ground. 
I need air. I need someone else to be there. 

Ashamed; desperation comes at a lonely price. 

I’d pay more for the courage of ultimate undoing, but fear of unknown retains me.

Looking down, with my eyes blurred at this cursed  unknown. 
Lose grounds, wind blows. 

I need a home. 



[I just don’t know anymore. Am I a robin Williams waiting to happen? Not in a vein sense.. but I’m wondering how long it will be before I lose sense of hope.. where else to go besides the internet when “enough therapy”doesn’t exist]",1
Does anybody else feel like this?,Whenever i happen find my friends social media pages I feel so depressed cuz they had so much better friends. Even recent ones where all of my friends are there but they didn't invite me. I feel like none of my friends actually see me as their friend. Just some annoying kid. All my friends look like they are having fun and nobody has ever actually tried to hangout or be close friends with me. It makes me even more sad cuz I think about the future and how depressing my life will be because I never had any true friends. Do any of you have any advice?,1
I feel like I just can't make it on my own,"I feel like a huge loser. I'm a 26 year old female. I'm the youngest of 4 siblings and still live with our parents. Now my parents have a home in our state but a vacation home as well so they spend winters there. So I would watch the house alone for them as I was in school and working for maybe 8 to 9 months a year for the past couple years.

I went to community college and started a business degree. I changed and went to go for a photography and art degree-dumb idea, I chose a hobby not a career. I finished with the degree and only have one credit left for a business degree, however I've just put it off and never gotten back to it.

I enjoy all art. But I dont necessarily know that I'm going to go anywhere with the phtography. I've done photos for people and do enjoy it but I dont feel super confident photographing people and I realize how this degree path wasnt the best decision. However, I dont really have a career path in mind. I have a serving job at a busy popular downtown restaurant and can make decent money there. But that's not consistent and not a forever job.
 
Aside from being at my parents home. I have my own car and pay my phone bills. 

I was in a relationship that also just recently ended and was looking for a place together. Which is clearly not happening now. I was super excited for and hopeful this could be a good start and things just fell a part.

Anything in the area to live alone in my home ranges from 800 to 1200. So it's either find roommates or I dont know what. The problem is I'm not really a college student and I dont want to live with college students or freshly 22 year olds. I would prefer on my own or ideally with my age with my partner like I had previously been planning. 

I quit drinking because it has been adding to my depression and I'm just trying to stay busy getting as many hours at work while I process my breakup. I'm just trying to finish saving up my car and save to move out. But I'm terrified.

I feel like a loser still at my parents watching all my high school girlfriends getting married and have babies and I feel like I'm going no where. 

I dont know how to find a good career now basically with no degree that will benefit me. I cant afford my area but if I left I would have nobody and nothing. Going through a breakup. I'm greatful my parents let me stay here even when they do come home but I do have a very very strained relationship with both my mother and step father so, it's really just keeping to myself to get by.

I feel like I just made all the wrong choices. Wrong college plan, wrong degree, wrong jobs, wrong relationships, wrong ways to spend money. Just one wrong thing after another and I'm scared I'm too late to catch up.

I have friends years younger than me as home owners and I cant even muster the courage to move out of my parents home alone because I dont think I can make enough. 

How have I screwed up so much..",1
I just can't take it anymore,"I can't take this anymore. I'm not a human being, just a husk that performs daily tasks. I want to kill myself all day everyday, and it distracts me from accomplishing even the simplest of the aforementioned tasks. When did I become such a bad person? Why do I (drunk and sober) push everyone away with my shitty behaviour? I feel so lonely, no one tries to push past my problems they just throw me away because I'm not fun anymore. They're right to do that, I'm a fucking liability, but it stills hurts.

The world isn't a place for me, it's just a group of people who don't care passing off the responsibility of my burdensome existence to another group who don't care. And when people like me fall out of step or fall behind: no one cares! Swathes of young people wish they were never born because we live in a world where fucking up can make the rest of your life shit, despite the fact no one asked to be born and no one teaches you how to live.

There are a few things left to do before the grand unaliving, but writing this has taken some of the edge off so maybe I'll be safe after all. Thanks if you have read this, it'd be nice to know someone understands before the end.",1
Im such an inconvenience,Yeah.. I’m sure some people feel like me. It sucks. I’ve never brought joy or happiness to someone in the long run.,1
I want it too end sooner 😂,"You ever get the feeling of wanting to end it but you know you can’t so you just cry or hurt yourself until the feeling settles down or becomes hollow, then hate your self more and just pray tomorrow you get hit by or a car or miraculously die the next day… I pray reincarnation doesn’t exist😂😂",1
tired of waiting,"If all life is telling me is that I need to wait.  

My life sucks right now because nothing moves at my pace.  

I'm waiting for things to get better because there's nothing I can do right now, then why wait. 

This whole process sucks. Wish I was dead.",1
The urge to not cry,"Wow it’s hard to not cry at work.  Seeing things that remind me of when I was happy.  When I had no worries.  When there’s no one nearby the tears just come right out.  And if someone asks what’s wrong, I know I’m gonna let it all out.  And I’ll be embarrassed.",1
I have had the worst 6 months of my whole life,"A close friend of mine unalived herself my child hood dog died, my parents are splitting up and me and a girl have cut things off. 
I really don’t know what else to do, I have had a very very bad mental state recently and I don’t know how to get through it, my life is in shambles and it’s so hard.",1
"Another poem I wrote titled, ""Hollow.""","Put crimson petals on my eyelids,
I'm drifting further from where light is.
I don't know where my mind is,
It's long gone and I've gone lifeless.

I search for angels in my crisis,
but find cold devils in my iris.
I'm entangled by my vices,
strangled by what I've held the highest.


Depressed.
My mind is fully drowned in stress.


Detest.
I hate what's locked inside my chest.


Dissect.
I watch red flow like I'm obsessed.


At rest.
I swear I'll never be so blessed

I don’t know what I like to be called.,"I don’t know what I like to be called. 


My family named me Nilesh, but they called me Nilu for short. 
All my teachers and bosses called me Nilesh in some form or another. 
Some close friends called me Nilu too. 
Lovers never really called me any names, just “babe, baby etc…”, although there were exceptions.  Eventually I even came up with a moniker “ThatOtherBrownGuy “ and with that people just started calling me “Brown” or “Brown Guy”. Slowly I pulled more away from “my name”, or maybe I was pushed ?


I always wandered and walked, in New York, Mumbai and wherever else life took me, connecting with a smile and I’d like to think some humanity.  

I’m almost thirty now and I answer to no particular name these days usually, just eye contact, it’s how I know someone is actually talking to me. I feel almost content living in peoples memories namelessly, I don’t think I need that kind of recognition. 

There’s a melancholy to this, to be recognized almost solely by how I relate to people, how I measure up in their eyes.",1

I know it's just rambling but it just needed to get out. I was a fool to presume that anything would change once i found love. It's not existent. There's no such thing, just our hormones being crazy for a while. And once that's done, they get bored and get themselves a boyfriend.",1

The world is getting me down,"Just venting.  I already have depression and anxiety and need to dig myself out of an unemployment, money, drinking etc hole.

But now I'm doing this thing where the state of the world is getting me much more down, which hasn't really happened before.  In interpersonal interaction, it seems like people are very closed minded towards people with anxiety and don't accept ""weird people"".  I feel like I can't be a functional member of society.  

Then in my city, Milwaukee USA, there is so much killing and violence, reckless driving, and drunken madness and stuff.  Then wars, poverty, and all that.  Plus, how the ideological divide makes people hate each other for no reason.  And how social media gives people a false perception of what the world is actually like and is getting really bad for people,and  also seems to make people hate other and profess their superiority over others .And the madness and noise of the city and all that.  I need some more peace in my life.  I realize the world has always been pretty messed up, but it's getting to me.

How do you get out of depressive mode?,"I'm depressed about everything. Work, life, marriage. I sometimes feel life has no meaning.

Do you have tips to get out of depressive mode?",1
Existential Contemplation,"A few months ago, I was able to slowly overcome my seasonal depression by getting a new, amazing job; I was going to school too and was getting ready to plan vacations for the remaining year. I was making decent amount of income to afford my bills and save, etc. 

After my second month passes, I received the news, at work, that I was being terminated due to my training team's personal feedback against me. I had no idea they were unsatisfied with my performance since they egged me on constantly. 

It's been more than a week since,  and I don't know how to feel anymore. Apart of me is still grieving and feels devastated, demoralized, defeated, deceived, and depressed. I don't have any money to afford to buy food, so I normally eat one thing a day & have been constantly feeling deprived from food to the point where I no longer have an appetite. 

I will not be able to afford my bills for next month and understand finding a job could potentially take months. I have been trying to cope and move on, but I have been having trouble sleeping. I have spent majority of my nights laying in bed until I eventually get up and sit on the couch until dawn. 

I cannot believe this is happening again.... I'm trying... I'm trying so hard to fight off the other depressing habits.",1
Venting,"Hey Redditors I bet no one will read this which is good  because I just need to vent as I process taking my final decision on this matter. I am a woman of 33 years old with 3 kids ( 2 biological, 1 is my recently deceased sister), I am from South Africa ( which is the other good thing because reddit is not big this side) specifically in the Eastern Cape , feels like the bottom of the world. I do not know how to get out of the hole I have dug myself in. I am R75 000 deep in debt, I lived with my sister , who recently passed in December 2021, to add on her son needs to go to circumcision school in December, HOW WILL I DO IT??!! those type of events cost close to R30 000 ( and that is the basic deal) I don't know how to tell him he can't go, he is already passed his time to go two years I go, I went to school to study and improve my home situation but nothing till yet, I have all these student loans and nothing to show for it, honestly I envy my sister, she has rested she can't feel anything she can't hear anything and I am left with this burden. I can't sleep  because I can not pay for my daughter's creche fees, we have no food, I do not know what we will eat tonight, I am working a dead end job at a small company, honestly I feel like dying too. My eldest son is smoking tik, he quit school, How did I end up here??! what did I do wrong??!",1
No Place To Go,"I used to work a 9-6 job and it pays pretty well. But then the workplace became toxic and I was tired of traveling everyday, waking up early and having no time for myself. Also, I am an introvert who prefers not to talk all the time so the office life doesn't really fit me. So, I decided to quit. I found myself a decent work from home, freelance job and I loved it, and it's related to my passion for creativity, but it pays a little lower than my previous job. 

I thought my family would be happy for me since I explained to them that this gives me more freedom and it is healthy for my mind. So a year passed by, soon I discovered from my other relatives that they are not happy that I am 'unemployed'. For them, freelancing is basically unemployment (technically true) and they always tell people that I don't do anything in life. I feel like they are ashamed of me just because I don't work for a 'company' anymore. They treat my free time as laziness instead of thinking that I earned my free time because I finish my freelance work early and is based on my own schedule. It makes me sad that people would prefer seeing me work to death the whole day, than seeing me happy because I found a simple job that pays me enough and gives me time to take care of mental and physical health. 

In My Head:
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I am getting depressed over this mistake. Maybe I really am just a lazy person who doesn't want to spend the whole day working in an office. Maybe I am just a selfish person trying to work on his passion. At this point, I really don't know what to do. 

If I am wrong, I am open to correction. I just wanted to share this struggle because it's eating away my passion, my inspiration, my drive. I hate my life.",1

It’s been 3 months, no point in texting her now because it’ll be awkward.  Same thing with my friend I met 3 years ago, I told him how crazy life has been since I moved 1k miles away from our hometown. This was in December. He asked what’s been going on.  I haven’t responded, Haven’t even OPENED the message. I’m such a pain.  The only person I DO want to text because I feel comfortable around them doesn’t even text me back.

I was homeless then found a home...I really thought things were going up and them the plumbing messed up and the landlords said that I had to leave the comfort of our home so they could fix the pipes. So now I'm homeless again. Then my babies daycare closed for 2 weeks because they can't keep teachers in the classroom. In those 2 weeks I couldn't find anyone to watch my babies for 4 days and my boss fired me. So now I'm trying to find a new daycare find a new job and find somewhere else to live and I'm on the verge of giving up...maybe my kids would be better taken care of by someone else.

am I depressed?,"Hi everyone. Over the last few months have noticed some strange things going on that are just odd in my personality. For the last few months, I am tired constantly, I work out, and I have a sales job so it isn't physically jarring at all. I go to college 2x a week, and I nap A LOT. I take naps every single day no matter how much or how little sleep I get. I have noticed I do not want to talk to anyone of my friends or people close like family. So I purposely keep interactions brief and dull. Not too emotional because that's tiring. Some hobbies have lost enjoyment, but I still have every ounce of drive to go to the gym 5-6 times a week as I always have. Except for this last week. That is starting to go away too. I nap and waste hours and when I wake up I feel like crying or just feel exhausted and do not want to go. So I take my pre-workout with 400mg caffeine so that way I'm kind of forced to go. I feel sad randomly throughout the day and hopeless, my chest will randomly get these weird sensations like there's some impending doom coming my way. idk.

"A poem I wrote titled, ""A Place I Hide.""","My bed is just a place I hide, roses lined, and wrapped in vines.
Thorns dig deep and pierce my sides, it is no escape from an arsenic mind. 

My bed is just a place I hide, crimson petals cover swollen eyes.
Black stems encase me like haunted mines, a prison keep of my design. 

My bed is just a place I hide as I drift away to a world inside.
Collecting memories of an older life,
I recount all I loved and left behind.

My bed is just a place I hide, it brings no peace but it's out of sight. 
I rest my feet and close my eyes, and in sleep ignore my strife.

Advice i guess,"Hi everyone!
My name is Safire and i am 15 years old and i am non-binary *or transgender as some people say*

And i struggle with significant depression , and let me tell you it is not fun.
I struggle with the fear of eating too much/ too little, low self esteem, confidence issues, social anxiety issues, tirednesses/ no motivation - to the point where im too tired and dont want to do anything but just lay around all day, etc…

And it is not fun at all. Especially with the added fact that there are people out there that hate me all because of the fact that i am transgender. 

It is very hard dealing with all this, and i am in therapy, but it is still very very hard. I have no friends really, i dont really talk to anyone. And idk what to do, so i guess i just came here to introduce my self and ask for advice on how to deal with this and life in general",1

I was thinking about telling my counselor about how I was threatened with a knife as a 17-year-old and how that impacted how I view relationships, and then it shifted to wanting to tell him about the suicidal thoughts... I made an appointment for Thursday, but now I cant go becuase I don't have insurance. I can't leave my job becuase I don't have income. so I feel trapped. I just graduated last week too. I don't know how much further I can go, I feel my fuel running low- like I'm going to have a severely depressing episode sooner than later. That's why I don't want to give in to the tears- I don't know how far it will go from there, and now I don't have any place to go if that were to happen. Yesterday I had a tough choice to make and thought about hurting myself- thankfully I didn't. Today I thought I was doing fine, but it hit me hard again tonight. I don't want to be overdramatic. people have been telling me I'm overdramatic my whole life. I don't want to use suicidal thoughts in a manipulative way- that hurts people.

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t hold any hatred for anyone around me. But I don’t think I can keep doing this. I don’t want to keep doing this bullshit for 60-70 more years. 

It’s really sinking in that this is it. This is everything life has to offer. I wake up at the crack of dawn to do something I hate for nine hours. I get back home. And either spend the rest of my day asleep, or doing something I hate. I don’t want to be awake anymore. No one cares anyways. My family needs me alive for their own sanity. But I’m not sure how much longer I can keep going.

I’ve given myself a few years of leeway time to see if I find any new love for life. But it’s getting worse. I’m not sure how things could get worse from the pandemic. But they’re getting worse.

I don’t even have weekends. They force me to work on studying and homework on my days off.

It’ll never fucking end.",1
Just Listen,"I can’t remember a day where depression hasn’t visited to let me know it’s there. The only way I know how to feel better is to write about my feelings. If you are suffering know you are not alone. I hope you enjoy my poem. Please be kind 

Just Listen 

You’re hopeless and you’re useless,


I will push you to the end


Keep listening and focus,


I will break you, you will bend


Crack open the bottle,


Meet your demons, drink it up


The alcohol will silence me,


At the same time fuck you up


I’ve got your thoughts, I possess them,


You will do it as I say 


I’ll bring you to your breaking point, 


When the demons come to play 


Let go, quit the fighting, 


Be submissive to my needs 


The razor isn’t far for you, 


You may cut, Ill watch you bleed 


The pain replaces thoughts inside, 


Brings relief to a crazed mind 


Just do it, get it over with, 


I’ll forgive you from inside 


A demons come to play with me, 


Takes my brain and locks me out 


Relentless till I give into, 


Demands that push and shout 


I’m hostage to the memories, 


The thoughts, the voices deep 


Just play along, surrender, 


And your soul you may just keep 


There’s little more that you can do, 


Relax and let it go 


The voices can’t be silenced, 


They will own you, this I know 


Take your meds and cry it out, 


The fighting does no good 


The mind you have is broken, 


But you know that’s understood",1
it's getting hard these days..,"I'm on my meds, I take them every day. I do things to keep myself distracted.

But I just keep running around like a headless chicken with anxiety shooting through the roof and it's got to a point where I just vomit every morning. I'm always shaking. I started smoking again which is sad cause I was so close to quitting. 

God I just wish I could spill my guts out, then maybe I could feel some sense of relief.

I think I'm just gonna stay in bed these days. Fuck socializing, fuck friends, fuck family, fuck everything. I can't take it anymore and I just want to be alone.",1
"I thought my suffering would mean something, turns out, it doesn't.","I use to believe that my suffering would mean something someday, that, so many bad things happened to me for a reason.

But then I got older, I see so many people who are so much better than me on every single level and did not have to suffer like I did.

Now I realize, my suffering had no purpose. It didn't make me stronger. It didn't provide me with any lessons.

All my suffering did was hold me back, teach me that there are plenty of vile people in the world, and practically ruin my life.

There is no escape from this hell.",1
Can someone help me,"I'm an Asian 17m and I've currently been going through some tough times. It all started when I was closing in on my gcses, so I would spend practically all day in my room and would sleep for max 4 hours each day. Never got out of my room unless I had to eat something. While I was in my room I started talking to myself a lot (as in having conversations in my mind, not straight up talking to my self) and these grew worse when I noticed I would lay there for practically hours on end. I started feeling really sad, didn't feel like studying anymore and had no motivation in life. I would started daydreaming and literally fall asleep without even knowing. I felt tired every second of the day and didn't have feel like doing the things I once loved.

My life's literally plummeted down. I was a straight A student. Now I fail every class. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to die. I've tried to die. Ive tried to commit suicide a few times now. The worst was when I swallowed about 20 500mg pills at once and got taken to the hospital. I didn't tell my parents or the doctor what really happened, just that I had pain in my liver and kidneys and I vomited a lot. No one ever found out. 

My family doesn't know I'm suicidal. No one does. I literally talk to no one.

I just wanna know what I should do in this situation because this is getting worse everyday and I fear for myself. I wanna get hit by a bus or get shot in a robbery. I'm not scared of  death. I Just wanna die",1

so for context: I'm a person with depression, anxiety, adhd and bpd, who got out of psych ward in 2021. this is also where I met my fiance. 
my depression got better but my anxiety and bpd are not letting go. I've been clean for 7 months currently and I've been through bad shit by that time too. you probably wonder ""how are you still clean??'"". I'm only clean because of my fiance. whenever I think about doing it, the second after it to my mind comes ""he will cry, he will feel guilty"". so  I domt do it. crying from my reason is the worst that i can imagine for him. even if I already did. 
he's the only reason I'm still clean. and also the reason I'm not.. yeah. I'm really greatful for him and he makes me so happy. 
I'm so scared that I make him upset by my stupid thoughts or something else sometimes (he reassures me and helps me with it), everything is just so overwhelming now for both of us and I don't want to be another reason to overwhelm him. his happiness is my happiness. he is my happiness.

Stop pretending your depressed and admit you’re a failure,"Long Story Short
(sorry for the s***-post but I have no where to go)

I’ve been depressed for years now - don’t remember when it started it’s become my lifestyle - I feel numb in everything I do - can only relate or feel any sense of feeling to overall depressing things or stuff sad in nature. I don’t like anything I used too. Foods shows whatever. 
If anything it just makes worse seeing things I used to enjoy. 

Haven’t achieved anything worth mentioning for about 1-2 years straight - last ‘ achievement’ I had was getting into university however I dropped out so it’s basically meaningless.

My mum suffers from PTSD and depression and I’m starting to argue with her constantly - My dad abused her and started a case regarding their home and how money should be handled regarding the home - he won the case left her with no money and stripped her off benefits - I have no contact with my dad. He basically ruined our lives and dis-owned me. I never did anything wrong - got good grades - got into university - well behaved. My dad still doesn’t care about me I keep telling her that seeing her constantly down is starting to affect me. I only live with my mum and my environment at home doesn’t feel welcoming anymore - I don’t even feel like I’m at home - I have no passion or drive or inspiration - nothing to talk about and nothing to offer. I’ve become resentful and hateful of myself due to the fact I’m not doing much or achieving - I constantly feel I’m worth nothing and I’m slipping into those suicidal thoughts and the thin line between ‘doing it’. 
I should probably stop blaming my mum and admit I probably feel this way because I’m a failure.


I have had a porn addiction probably since I started watching porn - I remember I used to masterbuate and sperm didn’t even come out it was blood. Very young age. Still didn’t stop. 21 now and have lost every single girl I’ve had relationships with due to having PIED and inability to satisfy women. 
Thought that would be enough to call it quits but the loneliness and fact I know I won’t be having sex any time soon keeps me in the loop. I’ve never had sex properly before lost my ‘virginity’ on Viagra got told by the girl it went ‘in’ and was satisfied with that 
I lost my virginity just to tell people I did 
I still feel comfortable watching porn

I don’t know how to talk to anyone yet alone girls - isolation has turned me into a complete werido.

I want love, girl friends and an actual girlfriend but knowing how I live - the insecurities I face 
I know how the world works
I won’t be able to have any of that and enjoy life until I’m ‘okay’ or ‘normal’ in other people eyes.

No girl is getting excited over a 21 year old boy balding - with erectile dysfunction - no job - no goals or ambition - no confidence or sex appeal.


I’m completely lost in life and have no clue what the fuck I’m doing.

I just smoke weed and make money here and there usually when I’m close to going flat out broke. 

I also have insecurities - I started losing my hair early in my ‘teen’ years it got so bad I stopped going out if I couldn’t wear a hat or would always wait for it to be dark.
I used my inheritance money from a dead relative to get surgery to try fix it in Turkey 
This failed 
I wasn’t confident in my decision and didn’t do the best things to ensure the best outcomes 

E.g still wore hats, didn’t allow sunlight to hit hair, didn’t eat healthy, smoked weed, didn’t workout. 

Now I’m even more insecure about my hair as it completely fucked and when I try to go bald theirs scaring in my head.

I only told my friends 2 years after I done it - as I hid the fact I did for a while - they basically didn’t care 
So me being all anxious about and embarrassed was basically for nothing.

I’m a bum who mummy claims is still proud of 
I know she’s wondering how did her son become like this.
I used to be okay, normal but now I don’t even know who I am 
What Im like 
What I’m meant to be doing 

All my friends are doing great things and I’m not on their level it’s only a matter of time before I’m completely alone.

I can go into further details for better understanding but this is how I feel summarised. 

Any advice is appreciated I really don’t know what to do anymore - I know I’m supposed to find my purpose and meaning in life but everyday I only see darkness and feel empty.",1
I need a win. So bad.,"It’s been one hell of a year so far. An emotional roller coaster ride. Especially this past month it’s been getting worse. I lost my best friend (as a friend), lost my job of 5 years, and replaced it wi the a job I hate; I’ve had to move out of said best friends house due to the toxic nature of living conditions; moving back into my dads’. I’m also facing bankruptcy, I’m facing losing pretty much everything. Then, to top it all off, my crush turned me down the other night. It’s been a never ending cycle of fail after fail after fail. I just need a win… I’m a wreck, emotionally. I’m not sleeping well at all, nor am I following my diet as closely as I want to.

I just want to be happy again. I want stability, but it’s been a hell of an ongoing process.",1
Byfar I have realised materialistic things Can bring happiness,"I am 18M living in a sophisticated place well in the country I live is overpopulated and it’s difficult to be rich if you not already are. I cry my lungs out nearly everyday as my own parents does not take responsibility and fight like dogs and cats, I am fed up because my parents both of em belong from a well settled family and its only me who needs to fight my way out because They have been kept me deprived of Hapiness,love, support and ofc to some extent money( except the necessary goods) Now I do not drink/smoke and I just want to live a healthy simple and happy life PLEASE HELP WHAT SHALL I DO ?!",1
Authentic rant,"(22m) I just feel so alone. I work very hard to support a wife and son that I continue to grow distant from. I understand that I am young and that there is still plenty of life worth living, but I’ve been busting my ass off since I was an early teenager. I was kicked out of my house at 15 due to drug use(cocaine, weed, heroin, you name it). Yes that’s right I said it a 15 year old on some hard shit.. I’ve come very far from said point, I forced myself to finish school, picked up the trades as I carried along and now I’m here, making very nice money, owning my own home etc. all the nice things that make a happy family, but at what cost? I’m never fucking home I just work, I’m not social, all I can talk about is work all I can think about is work. I just don’t know who I am or what to do, my wife and I have a great relationship but I just feel as if I’m alone and there’s no one here for me. And in this society of men I’m told to just stuff it all down “ it’s normal you’ll get used to it” I just don’t care to. I want to feel complete. I want to feel whole. I don’t want to feel alone. I don’t want to fail my family. I could go on and on about how fucked up my childhood was and how whoa is me but I know I will get nothing from it. So I sit here in a hotel room 544 miles away from home at 3 am typing a blob of a paragraph out trying to explain what it’s like to be so forsaken.",1
a vent,"everything in my life had been consistently unstable. all of a sudden i’m on good terms with my mother! my father comes back from his business trip. me and father have a nice day together! we get into a huge fight were he essentially says i don’t care about our relationship. my birthday comes! i don’t get cake, father doesn’t wish me happy birthday, and mother didn’t plan anything. i get a birthday dinner! but high tensions with only me, mother and father. mother whips out cute candles and a card! my dad doesn’t acknowledge me at all. i finally get my present— cutting my hair, father is pissed that he has to drive me to and from the salon. 

i could most definitely keep going but you guys get it right? it’s always up down up down down left right left. this is consistent. and all of this is happening right after i got of a mildish depressive episode. i know there are some petty things in there but they still hurt. they remind me that nothing will be as it was before and unless **i** put in the effort of making them the parents i want them to be it won’t happen. i’m just tired of this. it’s not my responsibility to make sure i have good parents! but if i don’t do anything about it, nothings going to happen. it’s going to to stay the same. then get worse because eventually in a year i’ll turn 18, want to go to college and beg for their financial support. it’ll be worse then. i don’t want that. but i think i’ll have to. i hate this feeling of helplessness. i don’t deserve it. this. i deserve the world and then some. but i have to deal with the cards i’ve been dealt right? 

i have friends but they would never be able to understand, and the ones that maybe could understand? would feel bad because this whole time they’ve been unloading all their shit onto me and i’ve been going through all of this shit saying it’s fine. 

it’s a predicament and the answers are ever so clear i just refuse to accept shitty answers easily.",1
broken hearts,"the worse part of being in a relationship is when you're partner looks at you and says I love you as a friend. I just want to be friends. how many heartbreak do you have to have to realize things won't change. you pick up the broken pieces to yourself every time. how many more times can you break before you can't be put back together? it kills me when a guy says I'm just being honest I've been hurt so much, please save it we all have been hurt. then people wonder why we are lost broken and bruised it's because we think our relationship is great or we are working out everything, and instead we are crashing and burning to the ground. we aren't on the same page. while I'm thinking you could be the one you thinking about ending things. while I'm waiting for you to come home your thinking about staying out. and yet we don't know what we are thinking about. salt looks like sugar. you don't get everything time you take a step back I'm hurting I'm breaking down again. wondering what is wrong with me. why can't we just work. I can't express how I feel to you because I feel selfish. how do you tell someone this life is just to much. the pain is to much. the heartbreak is one after another. it's like 21 bullets to the heart. I feel my wings growing every time I have a heartbreak. they hold me like a list child screaming out for help. it's hard when I hate myself. you want to be free and talk to who ever you want. I feel like you are a bird that I keep locked up because if I set you free you want come back to me. because nothing ever done. am I the only one who feels like this. I smile to you and tell you I understand how you feel but I don't. I just feel like you see only the imperfect things about me you see what you want and the rest doesn't matter. you hurt me because you want someone to feel your pain I get it I will let you do that. I'm use to it...",1
I don’t care tho,"I struggled with this half the week and the weekend - honestly didn’t care then either. I literally just don’t care. I would sleep all day if I could.

 I have these goals and shit but I wake up in the morning and just say to myself, why fucking bother? I literally don’t care. I don’t want to be alive anymore. I don’t want to exist. There’s no point in doing something that isn’t going to make me want to be alive. Even if I find success I’ll just feel a lack of connection to existence. 

There’s next to zero chance that I’ll make an impact on the world. All the advancing technology is going to come out without my influence, and all the money is funneled into the privileges instead of the workers who created it.

 Money won’t buy me anything substantial. 

There’s so many sucky people in the world. 

I don’t even desire sex, if I did I doubt it would make me care, and I don’t belong in the asexual community because I feel sexual attraction, but I won’t be a fitting sexual partner because they need to feel sexually desired.

I don’t remember a single happy memory for some odd reason. I’m also aphantasia so I can’t fucking daydream to escape reality. 

There’s nothing I want or care about about existence or life. It’s literally fucking pointless. The only meaning in life is what you make of it, well I literally can’t derive any meaning from anything. I just don’t fucking care. I don’t want to bother trying.",1
Rant,"I have nothing to rlly be unhappy about but I still am. Like I’ve had shit happen in my life but everyone does. Idk what’s wrong with me. I have so many things going for me and for any normal person they would be happy, but I just am not. I only have some things that many me happy and I feel like I’m over dependent on them… sigh.",1
What do I do,So I have been super depressed lately me and my ex broke up about a year ago but we tried things again and we were talking and out of no where she goes off with some new guy from another state when I asked her about him she said she was alway in love with him and I think that’s what hurt me the most was hearing that cause this girl was my rock and my everything as well as my best friend we originally broke up cause I caught her cheating on me with a married guy I’m just lost I have no one anymore and I am so lonely,1
what is the point of going through so much fighting every day,"Even if i manage to finish school
Even if i manage to get out of this country and study somewhere else
Even if i finish university and get a job or whatever
Even if i somehow survive and do what im expected to do i wont ever be happy
And all of those are big ""if""s
But even then

I wont have someone to love
Someone that loves me back
I will probably come home sad everyday
I will be haunted by trauma and people who lied to me and hurt me and this one person who ruined me
I wont have money to travel or buy a nice apartment
I wont have close friends i can open up to
I wont have a person to love and spend my life with
I will always be socially awkward and lonely and craving love and affection but never having it
I will never be happy
Even if i have positive qualities nobody will appreciate them or see as worth anything


What is the fucking point?
Please let me die mom and dad",1
I think I am going to be sad forever.,You know what I hate? The saying that “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” I don’t think my problems that have followed me my whole life are going away. I’m going to die alone. I’m going to be sad forever. I can’t take it.,1
at this point i actually dont have friends,Last friend group online fell apart because of me. Irl friend group doesnt exist the 2 ppl that talk w me dont even like each other and dont give a flying fuck ab me. It hurts but its actually better for the other party. Im a suicidal loser who gets themsleves fucked up nonstop. Itll be good because when i finally do it i wont fuck up anymore ppl than my parents and im already sorry 4 them. Such a fucking loser i am.,1
Hopefully Helpful Info,"I'm not a really active social media person, but I have been most active on Reddit, specifically at low points I have experienced. I've been on this page, reading posts and posting, at 3AM, all alone and afraid I was finally going to ""do it."" I have put guns in my mouth, I have squeezed the handle, with my finger on the trigger, tighter and tighter. No noise but chaos in my mind, like someone screaming in my head. Feeling distracted alllll the time, because I did have something on my mind. I've had some very dark times that began and stuck with me since age 8. I'm now 28. I have searched the whole time for ways to treat it. (I've also been active on r/addiction)

I say all that just so you know I know what it's like to need a page like this. And hopefully give you something you can identify with. 

All that being said, I've now been symptom free, depression-wise, for a bit over a month. And it has come with other blessings too, such as more motivation and energy. The best part is I am experiencing no side effects (Other males taking anti-depressants; Yes, no sexual dysfunction). 
It's shocking to me just how different life feels now. Not that all my problems or feelings are gone. But I'm not consumed by things. I can think more and more clearly through stressful and hurtful situations. It reminds me of the Claritin commercial where they remove the film from the lens, for my mind. 

The treatment I'm using is called TMS therapy. And I was very skeptical to try it. It's the best decision I've ever made. Completely life-changing. It's nothing crazy but it sounds like it is. TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, I'd suggest researching it for yourselves. 

I'm happy to answer any questions regarding my experience with it. I truly hope each of you, if anyone is reading this, find your solution. Whatever it is you deserve it. And so do all the people who love and hurt for you. Keep fighting good people. 

TLDR: ....you're on suicide watch right now are you really too busy to read a post geared to offer help or encouragement? 😊",1
Just feel alone,"Honestly, i've been having the best 2 weeks of my life. I've felt what i would concieve as happiness, my girlfriend and i have been doing amazing (besides yesterday and today) but this was a thought before that. I've been spreading myself kind of thin trying to be there mentally for everyone who is going through it right now because it always has seem in my life when things try to look up for me everyone else just gets forced down by life. (that is for another rant). But one thing i've realized is how alone i am. 

I try to be kind, and although sometimes i do pass unfair judgement onto others for looks, or personalities (i'm only human) i do my best to negate those by forcing myself to go introduce myself, or talk with them and give them a chance to allow me to get to know them because i feel everyone has some sort of story to be told and i'm genuinely fascinated by each and every one of them truth be told. I try to do my best to help friends, give money when i have extra, ( i know i shouldn't but i've been there when i just need an extra 20 to get through the week), i offer advice because although i'm younger than any of the people i'm around by the minimum 10 years, (gf) i've been through a lot and while i don't believe i have anything figured out and just sort of wonder around mindlessly, they think i hold the answers to life for whatever reason. I genuinely don't consider anything good of myself (insecurities and just literally no confidence in anything) but i do try and be a good person to the best of my ability, at least what i consider a good person. 

But lately, i've just felt so alone in a world full of people who claim to care. I've had a long long history with severe depression and although i know this up for me is temporary i've done my best to enjoy it. But if i still feel this way even when life has been so great the past 2 weeks then what hope is there for me to ever feel not alone. to feel like i'm worth keeping around because i'm just me, and don't provide a service. I just feel like people keep me around because they think they can manipulate me? which honestly some do and i can see it but shake it off as minor inconviniences because to me i don't see a harm in it, it's how they are and i'll sometimes call them out on it and teach them how to ask for a favor or ask me to do something without it sounding manipulative in the future. 

But even as i type this i can't help but think how it feels like honestly i'm in this world alone. and i have this insight to the world that no one else can see, and it's like no matter what i do, i can't seem to understand or fit in? i don't know. I just know that i wish someone would want me in their lives for me.                            and i don't get why if people do want that, why i can't see it. I guess this is where the down starts and honestly i'm not looking forward to it.",1
Anyone else feel this way,"Anyone else wish they were invisible? I always wish I could walk through a grocery store and not be seen by anyone. I wish I could go up to cashiers, buy what I have to buy, and just be forgotten by everyone I’m forced to talk to.",1

I am 28 now. I have been this depressed since I was 15. And this inferiority complex has ruined my life! Otherwise I am a healthy man, thankfully, I know, health-wise it could have been much worse. BUT I WILL NEVER GET OUT OF THIS INFERIORITY COMPLEX.",1
My big sister hated me in the past,"After what happened at my aunties house. My big sister started calling me names like loser, stupid, autistic, and trash.  And it really hurts me inside. There was no need to tell my parents since they don’t give a crap. I said to her “You don’t have to be so angry just because I didn’t play with the cousins. Worry about yourself first before you worry about others.” Then she said “Wow! The ‘autistic’ girl said something S-T-U-P-I-D again!” then I said “Your verbal abusing me! How would you feel if I treated you like that? What if I called you an autistic freak?!” I couldn’t control my anger! She made me so freaking angry!! After that she said “I’m not the one that is autistic! Why did you come to aunties if you were depressed?! What’s the FREAKING point of coming if you weren’t gonna play with our cousins?!” I said “I wasn’t feeling that bad! After I saw our cousins face I just felt a bad feeling inside me and I felt depressed. I really wanted to go home but I knew I wasn’t allowed to! I CANNOT SEE THE FREAKING FUTURE SO I WOULDN’T HAVE KNOWN I WAS GOING TO BE DEPRESSED!” She was shocked after what I said she didn’t answer me after that she just ran to her room.",1
"I truly am a horrible excuse for a human being, because of money","I wish I was wrong, but I don’t believe that I am. I can’t do anything right and never will be able to. I really am truly a waste of space, time and money. 

I always fight with my mom about money, because every time I get it all I do is spend, spend, spend. I have no impulse control and I can’t do anything about it. 

I can’t keep a job. Every job I had fired me, because management was crap, I have a bit of a temper, and I hate customer service jobs of any kind. 

I’m going to school for video editing, hoping to get a job in the field, but that won’t help me either because nobody will ever hire me no matter how good I am. 

I have basically already given up on having a life, because I can’t be helped point blank period. No therapy or medication can help me ever, because I have tried for too long.

I feel really guilty all because of one thing she told me.,"Me (15 M) And my current partner of 5 months (15 F), we’re once waking down a small path in my town, we’re chatting away, and somehow (I’m not sure how or when) we drifted into a conversation about her ex, but for some reason I felt down the whole time, as if this ex of hers 1-upped me at everything, but she keeps going, and I just listen, then she drops a line that killed me, before I share what she said I need to clear something.

I struggle with wording things.. ALLOT.
and allot of the things I say/come out with are not intended or intentionally insulting to people. So me being the idiot I am once in a conversation with my gf, as she described her feeling “built wrong” I said maybe it was because she didn’t eat. (Yes I know I’m the asshole for that and it kills me with guilt every day that I remember it..) but that’s enough background

As I was saying she’s rambling about her ex at this point and all I can think is “wow, she’s so much better than me” but then she said this one thing and I cried instantly as my heart stopped. I remember her saying how she misses that her ex used to call her beautiful everyday and that she never insulted her and had little quirky things like heart fights or kiss fights over text. And for some reason it hit me so hard I cried for about an hour and all I could think about was suicide for the next day. Am i over reacting?..",1
hell,"my life is already hell. i’ve struggled with chronic pain and and a fucked up body, major depression,anxiety and loneliness for almost my entire life. no one sticks around, including my ex. why should i stick around any longer? hell can’t be any worse than the existence i currently have.",1
Anyone else who’s worried about being diagnosed and put on antidepressants?,"I lost a lot of weight over the past two years because I’ve been too sad and worried to eat and my family keeps telling me to see a doctor (they don’t know that it’s because I’ve been so depressed though, they just think it’s something medical) so I finally did and he was asking me about why I’m not able to eat enough and I kinda just let it slip that I didn’t feel like eating because I’ve been too preoccupied with other stuff and can’t eat when I’m in a bad mood. I didn’t feel comfortable lying to the guy because you’re supposed to tell doctors the truth, right?

But now he wants me to get another appointment, probably because he wants to talk to me about depression. I’m just really worried because I don’t want to be diagnosed with depression because it might lead to him prescribing me with antidepressants and I don’t want to become reliant on them and then end up as an addict. I don’t really know what to do",1
here we go leave me thanks,"Its okay when u asking me if u should go back to ur ex because u still like them and its okay when ur being a complete fucking asshole to everyone for no reason and its okay when u treat me like shit but when i loose my shit hoho!

No. What do i get? Complete cut me out yes thank u. Thanks really. You know what i hope u fucking die. I cant care anymore. I lost all feelings for you. Oh and ""fuck you."" too.",1
all hearts need time to heal,"today I witnessed something. something that most people forget about. men have feelings too. their heart needs time to heal too. and sometimes you just got to let your man cry because what he doesn't tell you is that he's broken he hurts and he's tired. and sometimes the pain is just too much to tell anyone about. whether it's losing a grandfather that you loved and you wish you can have one more hug with, or a ex-girlfriend who has broken your heart used you mistreated you and made you feel like you were nothing to nobody. let him cry let him scream let him heal from the pain that is inside of him. sometimes the only thing you can do is wait. wait for him to open up to you and it's the hardest thing. but once you build trust with him he will show you that he's just like you he has feelings too. I've come to realize that he's locked away his feelings like an animal in a cage. and he's gotten so used to the darkness that he just saw the light through the dark and got comfortable. today was the first day I saw him cry. and the pain in his eyes was like no other. we sat next to his Grandpa's grave and just sat there and he told me stories. and I realized that his heart needs healing just like mine does. he doesn't know how to treat anyone because he's been treated so horribly. every person that has ever pretty much common contact with them has shot him down like a wild animal with no remorse no guilt. just hurt them to be hurting something.. as I held him in my arms I told him let it out cry scream yell he did. the shakiness of his voice with tears in his eyes I realized he has feelings just like me or you or anyone else thar has read this.. don't tear down your loved one just because they cry whether it's a woman or a man let it out because you don't know all the hurt and pain that they feel in one day is just going to be too much for them. and if you don't listen if you don't hear them there's silence would eat them away and before you know it it's too late. I've noticed that he isn't quite grieved. he's lost broken and bruised and it's just looking for a way out. respect your loved one give them the time the ear the shoulder to cry on to show their feelings.",1
What is the next step?,"Just ignore it, but I constantly go through episodes where I do think about committing suicide. The only thing that stops me is fear tbh. I don't care how my family or friends will deal with it. 
What is the next step people usually go with? How do you finally decide to go ahead and do it?

I think about how I'm going to spend my miserable life either deep in student debt or settle for a career that I don't want to. Especially, knowing that I'm going to end up being compared to my siblings on my love life and career, looks, etc. 

I kind of already feel that way because my sister is 20 and has been getting her shit together. I'm stuck being epileptic and my health limiting the jobs I could potentially go through with. 

I've recently have just admit that and deal with that I am the ugliest out all four of my sisters. 

Idk it's just these thoughts that come out of nowhere. It's slowly been snowballing to me not caring for others' feelings about my death. It's like I'm tired of having to keep it together to not burden anyone. 

Is it my environment? Is it just me? Idk",1
Why would I have a desire to live if my life was the interest of my parents but not mine?,"Bringing me into this world was not my idea, it was out of my interests, i never asked to be born. So, why would I have a desire to continue living? It is like ""you didn't ask for life but we brought, now find out by yourself, loser"".",1
ive tried and been trying so hard but nothing works i guess. im so tired.,"I’ve been a depressed and emotional wreck ever since middle school. I worked it out for a minute and was doing pretty amazing in high school. Once I got to my first semester in college tho, everything went down hill to the worst I’ve ever been. Nonetheless, I was able to pick myself up, out of the lowest points, and get better again. 
Now it’s my senior year of college. And now I feel lower than I’ve ever been. I try so hard on all aspects of my life: academics, self care, hobbies, social life, literally everything. When I get in a bad mental state I put whatever energy and emotions into positive things that can only help me. However, I feel like I’ve gained nothing and have gotten no where. I feel like I’m still the same person stuck in the same place, no matter how I may change my views or aspects of life. No improvements. I put hours upon hours upon hours into my studies, still get poor grades. I put hours into self care (working out and taking care of myself) and still hate myself, physically and mentally, for I notice no improvement. I always reserve time to see my friends, but a good majority of them just fall through for various different awful reasons. The only things I really find comfort in are my hobbies and my family. And even now I find myself wanting to become one with my mattress and just be. 
I feel hopeless. I feel lost. I feel tired. I’ve been trying for years. Years. And nothing seems to have changed. I’ve been seeing a therapist for years. Idk. At this point I’m just barely able to push myself. 

this was longer than I wanted it to be and I know no one really reads these or really cares, it’s all just venting. But I guess this is where I’m at. I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to stop fighting. I have people I love and who love me. But I’m so tired. So tired and hopeless and in pain.",1
to my relationship,I'm not happy. I don't feel the way I thought I would feel being in a relationship. I feel misheard mistreated like I'm pretty much just dating myself in a relationship. like my thoughts don't matter my feelings don't matter that is all just a waste of time. being in love with somebody who doesn't love you back tears down a relationship. it's tearing down my relationship. not wanting to be in a relationship with somebody because you don't have feelings anymore it's quite sad. not wanting to talk about the problems in relationships is what makes them become no more. am I the problem? am I what's pushing you away slowly and slowly as you drift away. you say you need space and time but you might not ever be ready do I wait? or do I just leave it behind. you don't talk to me you won't open up you shut me out like I am nothing. when it is our anniversary you just say it's another day. but is it just another day to you. were you always like this. so dark and gloomy no feelings no remorse do you feel guilt. do you feel anything or is it just nothing? what am I supposed to think when you don't talk to me when you silence me like a prisoner banging on the rails begging to get heard for somebody to hear them. you make it seem like I am the problem. when you hurt me you call me a baby and tell me to suck it up. when I tell you to get off of me you laugh about it and don't understand that I simply just don't want you on me. you're fine and sweet gentle and at some times loving and apologetic. so how can the devil have such a hard grip on a beautiful soul. I thought about ending a relationship and I keep telling myself those who ate patiently get the best in return. but is that really the case? I feel like a ghost that walked through the room screaming begging crying for you to hear me but you simply don't you don't see me or hear me will I die not being able to say but I want to say to you. I'm not like your other relationships. but will you ever know that probably not. just another person to you but you mean so much to me. R.I.P my relationship.,1
Over everything,"I’ve had a strange feeling lately like everything is wrong but in reality nothing is actually going on. I’ve felt overwhelmed with work, college, a failing relationship, and financial crisis. Nothing seems to be going right and I’m at a ""what’s the point?"" phase. I no longer have a drive or motivation for anything. Some days I think of ending it but I don’t even have a drive for that anymore. I push myself to do things but I just want to be alone. My boyfriend has tried being there for me but after everything we’ve been through I just don’t get satisfaction from him or anything. I’m tired but I don’t know how to rest.",1
I feel so shitty when talking about it,"I had an attempt in 2020 and it's sometimes brought up in conversation. Today it happened again.

I've never spoke to anyone about why I did it, it's usually just an ""I don't know"" response. When it was brought up today, my friends started to insult me about it. Calling me stupid for doing it for no reason. I didn't know how to respond and I felt so shitty about myself for it. I just don't know how to speak to people that I have this issue and still struggle with depression. I don't know how to respond to questions about my overdose so I usually just laugh about it to move on. Wtf do I do in these situations",1
Not so fun fact,"Something I think about sometimes is how when we are so depressed about being alone and not having anybody, is that even though we would like to die and go wherever the afterlife is, we’ll still be alone when we get there.",1
21 going thru it,"Nobodys cares, its almost like they dont want us to end things so it wont disturb their peaceful little lives. Nobody is hearing our cries for help or just pretend so they dont have to deal with it cause lets face it, its just an inconvenience for them. Nobody really cares and when u survive an attempt or they notice scars on ur wrist the only thing they do is make you feel guilty about it. Most people only wanna take actions and reach out when it’s too late so they can reassure their conscience. Tbh ive been depressed for a few years now and have a long history with self harming and suicidal thoughts but i never trauma dumped on anybody and although i never show others how im actually feeling, the minute i stop faking being happy my « friends » avoid me cause im bad vibes instead of actually trying to understand whats going on. Im always the first one to call when they need to vent, im always here to listen to their problems but what if i wanna share mine? But What if i want somebody to hear me out and tell me everything will turn out alright? i just feel like my screams are background noises that nobody pays attention to. I have a friend who knows ive been suicidal lately, she just msg me to check if im still alive when i say i am, she lives me on seen. People just dont care man they let you battle depression and get ur ass beat and wont hesitate to ask for ur help when they need it and never offers theirs. Thats the first time i say that but Ive even lost faith in god, i still believe the existence of god but i dont believe that hes there for me cause all my prayers have been a waste of time and hope.",1
Why is my life so bleak.,"Do you ever get the feeling that nothing matters anymore? I wish I could just disappear and never see another soul again. 

Statistically, I will never own a home, I’m already having a hard time finding a job. So what is there to work towards? I’ve made some bad choices in life but so what? Who hasn’t? Why are my choices so hard to come back from? I didn’t hurt anyone. I made my choices out of love and also out of fear. 

You’d think I’d be happy. I have a wife who lives me and dotes on me like I am her moon. She would give until there is non left to give, all to me. What a selfish person I am. She is perfect, and her perfect mate is out there, I feel guilty for keeping them apart. I feel guilty to the nameless person who can love her more than I can. 

It’s existential to its core. I’m so small compared to the buildings we build. So small compared to the stars. So small compared to even Pluto. The smallest giant rotating rock in our solar system. I’m so small. When I die, finally, the world will keep moving, the wind will blow, the birds will tweet. I don’t believe in a God. So when I die, finally, I will be dirt, or another animals dinner. What a waste of time. All of this to become dirt. 

My wife begs me not to die, forces hope into me. But I want to disappear so bad it hurts. These people don’t need me. They just need food and water and shelter. Not me. And shouldn’t I think of what I need? Because when I think of what I need the only answer I can come up with is “an end”. 

Besides, shouldn’t I control when I die? Isn’t that my choice? I never chose to be born, if I had the choice I would’ve taken the wrong hallway, or floated into another dimension entirely. I wouldn’t have chosen this. My Brian is so tired of this cycle.

I just want this to end. I can’t do this mundane life bullshit anymore.",1
Stuck in my room,"Right now, I feel like I am wasting my life. I feel like I've wasted my twenties, and I feel like my life isn't within my control.

I've got no real friends, hardly any family that I talk to, I was bullied all throughout school and it even trickled over into my first job. I feel like I've spent the majority of my life trying to prove to people that I am not the bad guy... I'm a quiet person with a nonchalant attitude, but I'm not understanding why people are always against me and not willing to give me a chance. I'm kind, anything that needs to be done I'll do it. If someone needs something I go out of my way to do it for them. But people never do the same for me. 

I hate my country too. I hate the people in it, especially the women of this country the most. They've been mean to me since I was a child. As a child, at 10 years old, I've been cursed out by a 20+ year old women in front of my school, she threatened to ""fuck me up"" in the parking lot of my primary school, in front of so many other children. I've been called ugly by an adult, someone's mother at 10 years old. I've had someone's mother wait for me in front of my middle school with a bunch of other children to do lord knows what. I've had parents try to prevent me from participating in my primacy and middle school graduation, because i caused their children to have bad grades... even though i was hardly in class. 

I've had a bus load of children scream at me to die, to kill myself, wish that I was dead.  The bus driver reported it, and the next day I only got in trouble for it, and not the other kids. Pictures exposing me were posted on Facebook, my boob was hanging out, the students that posted it, never got in trouble. I got bullied by a teacher in middle school, the result in that was I kid you not, they tried to send me to a mental institution. 

I was told that I am the reason why I am treated so badly, that I'm just getting what I deserve. If I didn't give people a reaction I wouldn't get treated so terribly. This lead to me not knowing when I am being bullied. I have to rely on people pointing it out to me. I'm broken. 

Being bullied all my life has lead me to hate my country. I hate the people. Deeply. So much so that I confine myself to my house, my room, to avoid interacting with them, because of the anxiety that I get from being out in public in my own country.

I'm happy, not depressed, and a functioning adult when I am outside of my country. I am able to go outside and walk around with no goal in mind, outside of my country. I am able to make friends, I have made friends, outside of my country. I try new styles when I am outside my country. I found love once outside of my country. 

I've been back in my country for 8 days. I have not left my room in 5 days. I have begun to believe that I'd have a better quality of life inside of a prison than I do inside my country. Why? Because people would actually interact with me.",1
Feeling down,"Im too scared to do anything and have never done anything (I sometimes substitute the urge with a red pen), but lately the urge to sh is getting worse and worse. I’m only holding back because of one person and I feel like I’m making things worse for them. Atp I feel so worthless and that I make like harder for everyone around me… though I shouldn’t even kid myself into thinking I’m that important",1
"I just want to have some time alone, is that wrong?","Before Rachel died, we called when I was at my aunty's house, my big sister was playing with our cousins but I just wanted some time alone. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling the best I was tired, upset, and depressed badly so I just wanted to be on call with Rachel. My big sister kept telling me to play with them and saying how I'm a bad cousin. I said to her I wanted to be alone. I was feeling very sad but she just said rude things to me which made me feel like I was a bad cousin going to my aunty's house without playing with my cousins. I was going to play with them after a few minutes but I felt like a bad cousin because my sister. Then she said I'm autistic which made me cry inside. Tears fell down my face after, Rachel told me I wasn't a bad cousin; I just needed some time alone. She said everyone needs some time alone for once. Her words helped me, but my sister went inside the room I WAS in and started being rude. Rachel tried helping me but then my SISTER took the phone and turned off the call. I started to cry and i just said Frick you to her and then my aunty got mad at me! My sister always swears and my aunty doesn't even care and I'm only 1 year younger than my sister.

I couldn't play with my cousins because they would make me feel even more awful.

Did I make a bad choice? I was just pretty much depressed and playing with my cousins would make me feel terrible. I really wish i never went to my aunty's house if this was going to happen.",1
Despairful situation.,"Please don't walk away from this post, if you think you can help me somehow. Every bit of information would be handy. ""Many a mickle makes a muckle.""

&#x200B;

Hello everyone. Apathy and tiredness are covering every inch of my body, and they are also in mind like a cobweb. Every actions feels like a miracle of will, a mountain to overcome. I have to cope with mental (and sometimes physical) paralysis before starting doing something, and there is still high chance of just throwing it away to favor something else, being confronted with gritting of a huge stone on the granite floor, echoing in thoughts. Life feels like a casino - I always lose. And sometimes it feels so unreal, that I almost see myself falling from height and taking damage of few health points and not death. Strange... Yet I won't do it, because some wish to life still insists in me. In every scene, every communication I see myself as a burden, an anchor to be dealt with. I am feeling really uncozy to be with someone, I don't want to talk, to make friends, albeit I know that socializing is the basic need to satisfy, it is just... leans to spectating?

&#x200B;

Main catch - due to some circumstances access to medical threatment and professional psychological help is cutted off, so I need to break through sleet with my own might. Looking for any ways to improve mental health - and it is not that importnant if they are strange, shady, unpopular, unpolished, e.t.c.. I think at least some action to improve is better than inaction.",1
I’m just tired,"Why does everyone want me to stay? Why can they always be selfish but not I? I don’t ask for much, do I? Sometimes I just want to disappear, but I can’t since that’s “selfish, thinking only about yourself” but they can be selfish? Where’s the fair in that?",1
Why?,"Ever since I developed memory, all I've seen towards me is hatred. Mom dailed it down by the time I was 6 but my father, nope. He'd beat me up everyday that by the time I was 12, I just wanted to be done with this shit. He always kept me home and never let me go out like the normal kids. That's when I first asked myself the question, ""Why me?"" 
What have I done, so wrong to be the one to experience any of this? Is it my fault that I'm treated this way? Don't know if this is normal but I guess 12 year old kids shouldn't ask or even think of such questions. 
Mother tried a lot but the most she could ever do is give me a promise of empty words that it'll all be fine someday. Nope.
If none of this weren't enough, again, when I was around 15, dad said ""let's go get something nice"" l. Didn't get the context so I thought he'd finally like me enough that he'd get me something out of the blue. I still remember how I felt that day. We went to a Sony flagship and he brought a PS 3 and as soon as he he saw my face beaming, he said, ""This isn't for you."" All I could feel back then was the urge not to cry outdoors. Then I got curious. Why would he buy something like that if it wasn't for me. Then I sneaked into his phone one day, found out that the PS was for the child of a woman he was having an affair with. He wasn't the father (trust me, I wouldn't feel this bad if he was the kid's father) but again, that got me asking myself the same question. Why me? 
For my dad to ignore me and get something for a kid unrelated to him rather than his own kid, what had I done that was so bad?
Since then, I shut myself off of feeling anything. All I've done is mimic my peers. How they react to being sad, happy, all to try and blend in but again, failed miserably. I was bullied throughout highschool for being the kid who'd never come out and play and because I never was like the others. I was gloomy and silent. 
Now that I'm 21, I've mastered the art of blending in. Projecting the desired traits amongst peers but yet again, I still feel hollow. I've never enjoyed like these people have. Nothing memorable in my life has ever happened to me. The all too familiar feeling of being numb and hollow grips onto me everyday. It's still the same old situation, same old resent towards me. I've never loved anybody because that'd require me to open up about what I feel but truth be told, I don't even know what to feel.
I remember numerous situations since I was 12 where I'd silently go to the kitchen around 2 in the night and cry with a knife in my hand because I was too much of a coward to kill myself. I still think so too. I want a way out.",1
I just wanna disappear,"Not in the sense of dying (altho it would also be greatly appreciated) but in the sense of deleting all social media, all contacts, changing phone number, moving to somewhere no one knows and leaving it all behind, the people, the memories, the everything. 

I’m just so tired of everything, of people, of relationships, of life, of everything.

But at the same time I know it’s selfish, I know there are people who care about me and I care about them too, and it would be selfish to just disappear from the radar for some time or forever. But they’d get over it eventually, I’m not someone that is worth crying over, I’m forgettable. 

I just don’t know what to do. I wanna disappear. I wanna be selfish for once, but I don’t know.",1
Do I belong?,"Emotions? I thought they were my plaything.... but am I merely a toy at its disposal? They come in waves and leave me feeling pathetic to have even felt them, to even feel bad for myself. People don't care when I'm hurting, why should I? Hiding sadness hurts more than the sadness itself. What is my pain from? What I thought was the love of my life took my soul and tortured it to death, smothered every fiber of enjoyment I get out of life, ruined my view on trust and love. Am i broken? Maybe, but in the end it's my fault I couldn't make her happy enough, that's just how it's always going to go, sorry me, kinda wish we could've been better off. Maybe it's something from my past, I've been homeless, grew up fatherless, lived clueless, I still don't fully understand this world, it all seems so pointless when you look at it. I'll just close my eyes for the last time one day and that's it. So my idea was to be something the world remembered, thats good great.. not... but maybe I can find love and make sure I can help someone else with their pain, just so I can feel love again. I have happiness within myself, it's just battered and beaten up. I can say I at least try. Even when the tears try to come they don't, it's such a forien thing for me, I've had to numb myself almost to the point of no return. I'm trying to relearn my emotions. I don't like it. I'm just now feeling so much pain, but it's not normal, it's a pain that I can't turn off anymore, I just want to hold someone till it goes away. I don't have anyone to crave so I just hope for her. Any her, just the one who completes my soul, or whats left of it anyway. Am I allowed to want love? I just want to know what it feels like, I had fake love for 3 years and didn't know it, what is real love like? I'm to afraid to let someone in, every time I try they just don't respond. I just accept I'm not what someone would prefer, it just hurts. I try to workout,  sing, be funny, but for who? I'm still a stupid fuck who can't show love right, who wishes to have a family and just love my person forever. My lasts fleeting moments with her in my eyes. To enjoy drinks during a sunset, to feel every inch of her body and feel comfortable and passionate, funny laughs in the morning,  petty little arguments, Our favorite shows, just enjoy every part of each other in a whole. We'll always disagree on something but that's love right? Maybe... who am I to say. I've been having heart pains bad these past couple weeks, hopefully my deathbed isn't soon, I don't want other people to hurt, I also don't want to be alone, I want someone to wait for after death. My love, a poetry of beauty and intelligence. Whatever shape, color, personality, beliefs, it doesn't matter, I'm ready to love. To believe in someone. To not feel so cold and empty, physically like a hole in my chest. What am I writing this for? Good question. All I can say is, if your out there, take a chance on me.... please.",1

18 and scared - quarter life crisis,"Most people may look at me as someone who's whining and that I have plenty of time, and maybe I do... But I'm scared I'm going to run out of time before I know that I have.
With someone who has been diagnosed with ASD (autism), the outside world has always seemed threatening, so I procrastinate to have as little contact out there as possable, especially with people since I'm not very good at speaking to them.
My best friend whom is 17, I have known them my whole life, will be living in an apartment with their partner, moving out further away from me... They are the only friend I have. They have worked so hard at their waitress job for maybe over a year now, and I can't help but compare.
I've never had a job, I never completed high-school, never finished college, and half-assed my entry into online uni.
I wrore myself off as too cowardly and lazy, ashamed of myself and still am.
I still live with my dad, and it's just not working anymore, this doesn't feel like my home anymore, but I have no where else I can go. No drivers liscens, no job, no money.
I'm not really sure what job or career I should take up, I feel stuck and scared. I know I'm only 18 and I sound like I'm bitching about simple things that can be achieved through hard work and time, but chronic depression and anxiety along with my autism makes it more terrifying to do anything. What if I can't take care of myself? What if I can't hold a job? I am I too stupid for uni?
More questions fill my head with 0 answers, and I'm too scared to make a move, cause what if its the wrong one.
I understand that I could try and console my dad, but right now, he's going through a crises of his own, and it wouldn't be fair to him.
I want to be indipendant, smart, and confident, but those attributes seem too far to reach.
This anxiety I feel, it's almost too much, and I've terrified about the begining of my life for far too long, just unmotivated and scared to do anything about it.

My life Kinda Sucks,"I'm just feeling very terrible about myself and my life and I didn't know where to go. There's probably people dealing with bigger and more serious problems than me but I'll just vent on here because I don't have anywhere else to go.

It's my third year at university but what's supposed to be the best time of my life kinda sucks. I was an A student in high school but I'm now barely getting 50s. I haven't had my glowup yet and sometimes I wonder if that's really coming. I basically have no social life and I'm lonely for most of my days.

I haven't had a real girlfriend since I came on here and that makes me feel very sad and somewhat pathetic, like what if I die alone,  what if this is what and who I was destined to be.

I know people will tell me to work on myself, my confidence,  read books,  take on self improvement.  But I am tired of ""fighting"" my entire life. I'm tired of always being the underdog at everything, I'm tired of always being the one who needs to overcome impossible odds and still not be happy at the end of the day.",1
I'm scared I'll be alone,"I don't know what to do anymore. People keep saying that I'm young and I'll find someone but it just doesn't feel like that's gonna happen. I'm 24 and never been with a girl in a relationship or even just casually. My family is tied of me talking about it, and it makes me feel like they're tired of me. They say to just stop thinking about it but it's not that simple. When you see you're friends being happy with someone and when you go to work and see people holding hands how do you just ignore it? When you try to distract yourself by reading a book or watching a show and you see characters being intimate, how does that not make you sad that you haven't experienced that yet. Maybe I'm meant to not be in love with someone. I don't want that to happen, but it's really hard to believe otherwise.",1
Found out one of best friends passed away,"One of my closest best friends passed away earlier this month and I just found out about today. I am still not over the death of my brother, which occurred around the same time but last year. And to top it off, my ex and I are broken up after a 7 year relationship and I’m still not really over it; and we still live together. Neither one of us has the resources to move out, so we’re stuck.

At this point I just feel like my life is a joke. I’ve been trying to keep it together and continue healing from so much shit, but it feels like once I even begin, something else happens. Like life just hit a reset button on my healing process. I feel completely lost, and alone. I don’t really have support system. Shit sucks, I am beyond depressed, I’m losing hope. I feel broken, numb, and pretty traumatized.

Thanks for whoever is reading. I sincerely hope your doing well.
Cheers to depression, haha yay! (Sarcasm)

TL;DR
One of my closest best friends passed away earlier in the month. This is during a time where I am already struggling with a break up, the passing of my brother last year, and many other issues.",1
Anyone have days where they magically feel better?,"Today was one such day. I didn't feel cured, but it was like a massive rock was taken off my shoulder and I could breathe again, feel confident, chuckle a little and have some excitement about life again, and try not to care about the constant negative comment and stares I get outside of home.

Saying this, I also feel anxious about tomorrow, since often I'll just go to sleep and I am back to my usual depressed self again when I wake up.. Sometimes, though, I can get a ball rolling and slowly improve on things, but it's extremely hard to do since almost everything has to be perfect for me to not crash again, and many of those factors are outside of my control.

I do have a hypothesis as to maybe why, at least one part of it, but I won't make a long post about this, though I can say it relates to long term exercise and ketones.",1
How do you deal with bedtime loneliness?,It's dark and quiet. I feel like all I have are the thoughts in my head and the temptation to do harmful things.

Get me out of this hell,"I (f19) am in college. But the thing is I’m in hell. Everyday. I’m failing one of my classes and I have no passions for anything. Im undecided. Growing up and even till now, im not good at academics. Not at all. I’ve had tutors for every subject almost. And even if im good at one thing, there’s a limit to where im good. I just want to be one of those ppl have one thing their good at. I’m not good at match, science, writing. Nothing. At this point I want to drop out or take a gap yr and get a job. Really learn and prepare for adulthood. My parents work the ass off to get me here but why am I here if nothing is going well. I haven’t told my parents the truth about how im feeling. Mentally I’m just a blank. It feels like I’m just trying to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. My brain is on autopilot or something. I don’t want to worry them and start something. I just want to be smart. I just want to have smart brain. A brain that makes me school smart. I don’t even have the guts to talk to my friends about how im feeling.",1
I think I need to commit myself for psych evaluation but scared to let others down.,"I’ve been depressed for years (properly diagnosed at 16, now 22) and have had my fair share of breakdowns because of it. I’m in a really bad spot (suicidal ideation) and see that I should get help before it gets worse. However I’m a department manager at an understaff store and my family is already going through enough. I know I should worry about myself first but I’m just struggling with that. I just want to disappear and take a long break from life.",1
feelings,"i feel so fucking empty nothing brings me joy its just a cycle at this point, not even self harming makes me feel better anymore",1
Today started so good,"I woke up early felt good, wasn’t in much pain from working the night before. Got dressed an stopped for breakfast before heading to dialysis. But as soon as I sat in the chair for treatment I feel like a darkness has fallen over my mind. So many negative thoughts an just a feeling of bad. I don’t want to feel like this, I work hard go to dialysis an have a girl I love. Why is my brain trying to sabotage everything!?!?",1

Suicide thinking more about it,"Is it really bad, like is it? I can stop the pain hell I'll be free from this world, no one wants or needs me. I'm a burden to my family and so called friends...world is crap too, I'll be free from it aswell, seems like a win win!


Death sweet death would cure so many ills I have, it would be great really, yeah I pass the pain on but it won't be that bad, they'll get over it.


I think suicide is for me no stress no nothing I hate my life and even family to a degree its messed up but eh, suicide is calling me...",1
outburst 5-6months later,"So today, i've been deep in and depressed continuously since yesterday. Today I was been thinking about all my outburst and times of anger and emotions got the best of me. 

Is it me alone, or do anyone else go like some months on in feeling good, but shitty inside holding everything in, and just have like that one moment or week where all your feelings, all your emotions all come crashing down and just do all the  impulsive behavior that our mind is telling us to do, that leads to some damage control when you clear your head of all the thought and feelings that we've been holding in. 

I recently had one for thr 1st time since July 2021. I got so out of it I call the police on my gf and burned one of her wigs. Honestly I was so out of it mentally and emotionally, that after that I made seeing a counselor or therapist my top priority at this point..",1
Chronically Sick and depressed momma.,"I’m struggling with such strong depression because I’m sick all the time. I am nauseated and have headaches daily. Doctors have never found anything wrong with me, but I know something has to be wrong inside of me. Sometimes I just wish I could die and escape this horrible shell of a body. But I have a child and the thought of leaving him without a mommy scares me so badly. What if whatever is wrong with me does kill me? As much as I don’t want to live this life anymore, I don’t want to leave him. My child is what I live for. I would do anything for him, including living. It’s just such a confusion of emotions all inside of my head and it makes me feel so depressed and crazy and anxious and I’m just wondering if anyone else has these same feelings?",1

I can’t seem to let myself be close with my boyfriend and I can’t seem to let go of the shitty behavior I show towards my dad. I have a consistent need to be mean, because being soft has only ever gotten me hurt. But I have to say, I fucking hate this. I’m alone. I’m so fucking alone. I wanna be soft and I wanna be vulnerable. I don’t wanna be mean to people but I’m so scared. Ever since I could remember, from family to friends, I’ve been constantly shit talked at every age. How do I begin to be nice now? I wanna be happy and be loved, and fuck finding that within myself. I want it from another human being for once.",1
It just gets worse..and worse..and it never stops,"I guess I just need to vent somewhere.. because right now, I have no idea where I should just put it all away just for 2 seconds besides the internet.

It just gets worse, at least for me, as far as I'm concerned most of my then wrecked friends/buddies got better, or at least they seem better but I'm worse and the difficulties won't stop coming, are they?

Everything's that's been in my mind in the past days was my realization that my mother might be following (hopefully slower) my grandpa's path. She's been showing some symptoms of early onset dementia and when they're visible, they struck through me like lightening. She's 61, type 1 diabetic, she still takes care of her mother (my grandma) that is 88, alone by herself. Her brother died of a tumor when he was 13 and she 16 therefore I can sense the depression and some trauma.
But my point, I think in all this paragraph is that I've seen the decline of my grandfather and I can't even think about this but with my mother. I just..

I'm 21, I have no job, I have no career, my physical state is absolutely awful that my doctor was very concerned and when I told her "" I really wish I don't die of a heart attack while I'm walking"" , she was very.."" it's not that possible, but still possible considering..."".

I killed my body, I killed my mind, I feel like I'm a corpse that somehow managed to survive all the ODs, all the life/death situations and I'm here..and I feel like I'm in the same place but worse, like I was 10 years ago when all this nightmare managed to start. My mind is killing me and through my awful thoughts that are consuming all my energy, I manage to kill my body once again through different fucked up shits.

I go, I go to therapy, I've been there since a long time and when I finally start to see a little bit of light...It just vanishes.. It's gone and I'm back here, the same disk repeating itself over and over again.",1

my story trigger warning abuse,"so when i was only 8 mind that i am 15 and i am a male. my dad asked me to do a favour for him. and i did it but he slowly made it more sexual and i was in foster care at the time i still am. and he slowly made me suck his dick and i didn't know what was happening and i was so confused. And then my favourite dog star died while i was petting her in my arms when i was 10. And then i wanted to die saying its my fault star died and i would cry myself to sleep cause i wanted to stop doing the favour and my brother nick got dragged into it and that made me feel worse. and then when i was in grade 7 i was tired so i tried taking my own life and ended up in the phscy ward where i nearly got stabbed and it was an adventure and thats where i learned how to self harm and that was my new coping skill and that path sucked i couldn't stop and it sorta helped me. but the scars on my arm ruined my body image and i still hated myself. and in grade 8 i was getting bullied to the point where i broke down in gym. and then i snapped with anger and tried to runaway. like i kept planning to runaway and i once packed my backpack up with some clothes money and i left a note saying that i ranaway. and ofc i forgot to tell you that my foster mom used to yell at me when i self harmed saying your just attention seeking and that i should stop. and she would mimic me when i got mad and made me feel stupid so she basically gas lighted me and during lock down my mental health got even worse and i was basically crying on the inside but smiling on the outside. and on march 26 2021 i reported my foster dad and moved out of there crying and missing my old foster family it took me awhile to adjust to this new life i mean i moved schools in the middle of the year imagine how hard it was for me to make my friends. and now i suffer from nightmares and some ptsd,generational trauma after i learned that my real dad killed himself on 2011 after he sexually assaulted a person and that devestated me. and i sometimes want the pain to end and the sadness and everything to just shut up and stop being so hurt all the time. and i am always jelous of everyone with there good mental heath i'm sick of looking in the mirror and seeing my ugly self and i hate my body. i feel ashamed that i couldn't stop my foster dad from sexually assaulting my brother i fucking hate myself for doing his favour. i want to kill myself and make myself less of a bardon not like anyone would care.",1

I honestly dont know what to do.,"The other day, my gf and I had a fight. I think it triggered my depression. All of a sudden, I can't feel anything. I dont feel hunger. Guess just physical pain.

I also realized that whenever she's with her friends, she seems sooo sad(its evident in her eyes...even in photos). And after that she fights with me. I dont know what to do because i love her but my friends think that i should rest for a while and try to be with her after my rest. Me, on the other hand, want to make it work.

My ability to concentrate on anything that isn't my activity of choice is now almost entirely non existent. My schooling has suffered immensely.

I suffer from no lack of ambition, but that ends up being yet another curse. My ambition is to succeed in music. Which is going to mean relentless touring and being on the road and nobody's ever going to want that. Additionally because my ambitions border on obsessions, and that's yet another red flag.

I'm 28 and she's 26 we've been married for 4 years now, we have two beautiful children a daughter and a son. What's been the hardest is when she got pregnant originally neither of us were working and when she had our daughter the deal was whomever got a job first would work and the other stay home until we were able to have both of us working. That never really happened because I didn't want to work over night and be away from my wife at night which now feels really stupid but I didn't and then we had our son a couple years later and it all became even more difficult more money more everything it was then that my wife slowly stopped being as much wanting to be part of our family. Fast forward to just 11 months ago we argued one night and she tells me she isn't sure she can be with me anymore It broke me to my core, I lost all will to live for a while and then she told me she still loved me one day when I had gotten really bad I had reason to fight for us again and so I did everything she asked of me. I got to working I took care of the kids still but nothing seemed to be enough. Then there was another guy whom she more or less was cheating on me with texting sending nudes telling him she wanted to leave me for him and all the time she was still telling me she wanted to be with me and loved me.

Scared of my own thoughts and the reality of my future.,"Hello, so i am about to graduate college and since this semester has started i've began to feel extremely apathetic about my future to the point where i'm dreading graduating.

When I allow myself to think about this I begin to spiral and become extremely suicidal and nihilistic.

I want to get better, but I'm not passionate about anything anymore so I don't know how to feel excited about living. I came on here to see if anyone has any advice.

rant,"I don't even know why I'm writing this or who may read this but I've been feeling like this for a long time. I have no 'real' friends who would care for me or look out for me. I've always been the nerdy kind in school and am always by my self. Being an asian is a problem in itself. Parents and relatives always put pressure on you regarding what's right and what's wrong. Being a female, I'm stereotyped by family members. Idk what I'm doing at this point. I always have this distance I have to maintain with people including my parents. It's like if I cross that imaginary line, I will be judged. Hated. And not cared for. I always have to act like a fake, no matter in front of whom. It's that perfect image that I've been maintaining all these years. Perfect grades. All assignments perfectly done. Perfect daughter every parent would wish for. The perfect student that teachers praise. The perfect friend who would always be there for you. But behind the mask, I've lost myself. Even the people I consider friends use me for my work and toss me aside. My perfect grades and school status doesn't really affect my parents. They don't know my real self either. They never have time for me. Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing is right. Is it even what I want to do or am I doing it for others. It's just so hard. No one's knows me. The real me. I've always been tossed aside after being used up. Never praised for my work or acknowledged. Why am I the one who has to help others? Why am I always the one who has to help others fill the void in their heart? Why am I the only one who never gets to show herself? It feels like everything was planned out for me and I couldn't do anything but go about it without saying a word? It's just so hard to even type this without being brought to tears. I've never told anyone about this or let anyone know that I was broken inside. I want to meet someone who would praise me from their heart, care for me and not judge me for writing all this. Someone who would help me fill the void in my heart. Someone who would just acknowledge me and tell me that I could do anything that I want, without caring about anyone else. 
This isn't something that I've been feeling for a day or two or something I'm joking about. I've felt like this for years. Especially the last two years. The only family I have are my parents, brother and my maternal grandparents. We've broken ties with the others. Growing up in this family I've seen fights happen every week and the family atmosphere being extremely tense almost all the time. During online schooling, i  had to sit and study in a small room on the rooftop of my grandparents' house. There were pests there and I had to hang a curtain on the back so that the trash and junk wasn't visible. I was afraid someone from school would notice and mock me for it. I went to one of the top rated international schools in my state and in such an evironment, i still had to please everyone by getting perfect grades. Was i praised? No. Besides, i had never taken anything for granted in my whole life however such treatment suffocated me to the fullest. As I stepped up a grade, and the study pressure grew, i just couldn't keep up. I started to starve myself but for scolded. On the other hand, my grades dropped to B's and I was told to work harder by teachers. Did anyone support me? No. In the middle of it all, we were preparing to leave my country for the US due to my father's job. I would complete assignments in the best way possible and stay up till 2 in the morning then cry myself to sleep. But no one knew about that. No one ever knew about the stuggle I went through and still am. I started practicing s€lf- h@rm around two years back when I found out that physical pain could help me suppress my mental and emotional distress. No one ever noticed, or maybe I never let anyone notice. I worked hard to bring my grades back up, acted like nothing happened and didn't let anyone worry about me. That's what kept me going. Currently, i still practice it much more than I did then. It's something I rely on just to get back on track somehow. No one noticed it cause they didn't want to. I feel that I'm turning into a monster. I rely on pain to keep me going and that's just something I'm not proud of. 
Even if someone were to acknowledge me now, it would be too late to do so. It's been 4 months since we shifted to the US and my school studies were over in the middle of March. I've been trying to get back on track but with nothing to do or nowhere to go in such unfamiliar surroundings, my mind keeps diverting back to all that I've experienced. It's just suffocating.
If you think I'm fake or if you're someone who knows me personally, judge me how much ever you want to. I really want to start over once again in a new high school, a new place and with new people but I'm always pushed back down and told to not to be too confident. It seems I've lost myself completely now. I envy people who are happy. People who get to control their life. People who live their life and make every moment of their life worth it. I'm just not one of those people and I've realised that. A new beginning would just never be possible for someone like me. It's likely that I'll just be faking myself in the new school as well. 
I would say that personally I am someone who really likes to take initiatives to raise awareness about mental illnesses and overall mental health. I even joined an aid community in my previous school in order to raise awareness about the same but deep inside, i felt like no one actually cared about this. When I was a part of the community, I can ensure that I did my best to write articles and raise awareness but as someone with a mental illness, i know that this doesn't help much. People should be more understanding. They should care about others and their feelings instead of making them feel pathetic and feel like losers. I've felt like that numerous times during every single day. It makes me feel like I'm the one who's wrong even if I'm not. I'm always saying sorry or apologising for mistakes I've never made. I always feel guilty, regret my actions or feel pathetic about things that don't even matter to people. 
I'm losing myself and to even say this on an online forum with people who know me constantly checking my activity, it took me quite some time to just put this post up. I have no idea how you'd react if you know me. But I'm pretty sure you'd probably not believe it and call me a fake perhaps no one would imagine that someone who's always pretty much cheerful would feel or go through stuff like this.",1
No one is interested in me,"When I was diagnosed with Parkinson's, friends and family rallied around and I was overwhelmed with their generosity of spirit. Eight years on, I don't get about as much so I use Facebook and Twitter more to connect with the world. I write blogs, I make music, I take photographs, I post jokes, I post links to interesting things. I get a couple of likes from my parents (for which I am grateful) and then nothing. This month I'm cycling 250 miles for charity. This is a real challenge for me. Some days I struggle to walk half a mile. I've been posting updates with photos and I've nearly done it but it barely raises a flicker of interest with the people who are supposed to be closest to me. No one calls, no one emails, no one visits. I feel like a ghost.",1
Will it ever get better?,"I don’t know where to start. I don’t remember what it feels like to be happy for a whole day. At first I thought it was the gloom of this city’s weather, then now it’s spring my mood is still down. 
I have had no luck finding a job after I lost mine during the pandemic (I search daily/get some interviews but no offers). I live with family and we don’t get on at all. Home is not a comfortable place to come back to. And the cherry on top of the cake, I love someone who is emotionally unavailable and  probably has never liked me (I feel like he talks to me just to be nice/polite - no we aren’t even together and never had been) All I desire is a good job and the ability to afford a place to live in my own, cause sharing with strangers will spiral my social anxiety. (I’ve had nightmare experiences with house mates) I never want a handout. This city and its super expensive housing/living cost make me hate it. 
I want to leave this city/country but, I can’t afford it on my part time minimum wage job at the moment.  I sincerely don’t know how to stop dark thoughts…therapy is so expensive. It’s a never ending catch 22…",1

Trauma,i feel like trauma happens for a reason its like an obstacle that makes life suck. but as soon as you conquer it. it relieves you from the pain and suffering so keep on living and don't let your trauma get the worst of you. and be who you are don't let anyone bring you down or make you change. when a friend wants you to change they are not your true friend they are just a bitch.,1

"It’s getting bad again, and I just need some encouragement.","Hi all, I was struggling pretty bad with depression from early January of this year until end of February, then I had a good mental health streak from March right up until now. I got a new job, made some new friends, changed meds, I was journaling consistently, and I had a positive attitude about life. Now I’m starting to slip back into another hole like the one I fell into during the winter months. I’m suddenly unmotivated at work, tired all the time, can’t focus on anything or finish anything, not really looking forward to anything in life anymore even though I have some fun concerts and trips coming up that I’m trying really hard to be excited about. I know going to therapy more consistently would help, and I definitely need to tell my psychiatrist about my change in mood. However, I’m still waiting for benefits to kick in at my new job so that I can afford care. In the meantime, I’m open to hearing about anything outside of meds and therapy that helps y’all or even just some kind words to help me make it to my next appointment :/ thanks, everyone.",1

What’s the point,I don’t see the point in living. Every single day I wake up sad and alone no one talks to me calls me or has any interaction with me.

I don’t care about money or getting a house or having a wife one day I don’t see the purpose I’ve tried to have a gf several times they just leave or cheat on me and put deeper into a hole.

"sometimes i think if i actually went thru with it, i wouldn’t be here today. (TW)","once 2020 started my mental health got so much worse. my (ex) boyfriend (let’s call him W) broke up with me after cheating twice and in that relationship he made me do things i didn’t wanna do and if i didn’t do them he would be mad at me. the days he wouldn’t talk to me i would cry, i loved him then he broke up with me for a girl that left him after a week. but a couple days before me and my (ex) boyfriend broke up i met this boy (let’s call him C) and he would comfort me and calm me down and tell me how i didn’t need my (ex) boyfriend. and after me and him broke up the boy would still be there for me. and we eventually started dating. and he would tell me how he hated his family and how he wanted to kill his self and ofc i was there for him telling him not to. after some time of us dating he started lying to me about things. (during that time there was multiple people telling me to kill my self & calling me ugly, making fun of me, threatening me etc) one girl told me to kill myself. and after some thought i took a bottle of pills while i was babysitting my sisters. C & W found out. while W was telling me i shouldn’t do it etc etc. C was telling me that i was an attention seeker, i needed help bc i was crazy, i was delusional etc. i read a whole paragraph he sent telling me how he didn’t care about me, calling me names and wouldn’t care if something happened to me. all that because i tried to end my life. from then it just got worse, i started cutting myself in september 2020 and when my mom found out she yelled at me. in october 2020 i started cutting more and more to the point you couldn’t see my arm, it was covered in blood and scars. (i will always remember this date bc there’s a pic of me 5 minutes after i took 3 bottles of pills on facebook) on october 25 around 7-11 pm i took 3 bottles of pills and i started feeling dizzy and my stomach was hurting and i got scared so i threw away a hand full or two. then i went to the living room to take a family photo. i had to go the rest of the week in pain because no body knew what i did. january 1 2021, i remember crying by myself because i would tell myself i wouldn’t make it to 2021 but i did and i was proud of myself. the whole 2021 was just me having many panic attacks, crying about how i looked and self harm. to this day i still think about offing myself and i still think about C’s words. but i’m 2 almost 3 months clean.",1

Melancholic Structure of Life,"I hope to keep this brief as a simple reflection of my thoughts over the last few years. Of those who read this, maybe some can relate:

My trauma is subtle so I don't talk about it. It did not manifest as a result of a particular incident but rather day-after-day of feelings of loneliness, emptiness and desolation. 

As a result I am in an uneasy balance in my life. I both want to live out of curiosity, but want to cease to exist out of fatigue. The future does not interest me. I feel disconnected with life's structure.

School, university, first job, first love, marriage, kids, work, retirement. I have no doubt that I may have some fun along the way. There will be much to surprise me but nothing to make me want to keep going.

Despite the possibility of excitement in my future I have no intention of making it so far. I know I will, however, considering I do not have the energy nor will to end it all. 

It just seems that I am destined to a life of mediocrity. It all seems so dull and mundane. I don't know how to proceed but I know I must. 

I await a miracle, that is all that gets me out of bed.",1
How do neurotypical people just know how to handle life ?,"I need therapists, CBT apps like Bloom, medicine, getting high, and social media to heal my wounds. Even then it’s not enough. I will never feel happy sometimes.

After my dad died nothing has been the same,"My dad passed away to pneumonia after my mom ignored his symptoms for 3 months until I finally got him to go to the hospital. He came back bed ridden after a few months and died a few days later.

After that, my mom abandoned me and my girlfriend left me. Although we got back together I know that It’ll never be the same because of me. I attempted to end my life multiple times. I will never forget the feeling. It felt like I was in complete darkness and the hours passed by like minutes. I’m not even scared anymore and I know that my time is limited.",1

What makes life worth living?,"I first want to start off by clarifying that I don't think I'll ever kill myself but I've had that instinctual urge for a long time. Instead, I find myself greatly hoping for death from outside sources. I have a high paying job, loving parents and good friends but I feel like my life is a hollow lie. I was a cheerful person until 2 years back and I made friends with a lot of people because they liked my personality so I feel like the current me is just faking, pretending to be past me just to hold onto my friends. 

In 2019, the company I loved working at underwent major changes for the worse and my friends and I ended up leaving as a result. I went to study abroad and 2 month into college, covid struck forcing me to move back with my parents and thus began my depression. I was struggling with college because remote learning was not for me and it felt like I'd wasted so much tuition money because it felt like I was practically learning for youtube. My grades dropped and after graduating, I was unemployed for a while and I did nothing to change my employment status. 

When I finally started applying for jobs, I was lucky enough to land a comparatively high paying one but little did I know it was a scam. Everything that was said to me before I started here turned out to be lies. I now work 12 hours a day for 6-7 days per week and I want to find a new job but I'm so exhausted that I have no time to make an updated portfolio. My family needs the money so I can't quit. Everytime I step out of the house, I hope for a vehicle to hit me so I can either end up dead or in the hospital to finally have a break. 

I don't know what I want to do with life anymore. I used to want to move to Europe to work but seeing the treatment of brown people during the Ukraine crisis makes me think that that's not a good idea. My own country is one of the least safe for women and I don't want to work here constantly living in anxiety. I'm gay but my entire family is homophobic. In a few years, I will most likely be forced to marry a man and the very thought of it makes me nauseous. I used to be underweight (35kg) but now that I've gained weight (43kg) that I was actually happy about but the people around me constantly fatshame me that I don't even enjoy food anymore. I don't think my life is going to get any better from here on out. Living life just feel like a chore. How do I stop myself from ending it all?",1
i never do enough,"i'm really trying to do everything to make everyone happy, even if that doesn't make me happy.
everyone does a lot of nice things for me, to help me, show me that they're there, but I don't know what else I can do to give them back a little of what they gave to me.

Tired / Grief / Death of Loved ones and Moving on,"My dad died almost a week ago in a work related accident. My grandma who was practically my mom, does last week.

Lying is so much easier than explaining,"Since he left, I haven't had any physical touch. Due to covid, my friends and I don't touch. I didn't realize how much I would miss it. I'm not a very physical touch person, but lately it's all I crave. I am 1500 miles away from any family. I feel like I have already lived more life in my 23 years than some do in their lifetimes. All I want is to be hugged, all I want is for someone to hold me for a bit. I just need any type of physical touch. Sleeping is so so so fucking hard. I haven't been able to sleep through the night since he has been gone. It's not even him I miss, it's having someone. With everything going on, the hardest thing is not having someone. I just feel so so alone. 

Anytime anyone asks me if I am okay, I just say ""yeah of course"" because lying is so so much easier than explaining. Anytime I try and explain, I am met with consistent advice rather than just someone to listen. Sometimes I just need a yes man. Someone to tell me that my feelings are okay. Someone to tell me that my feelings are valid. I don't need constant advice, criticism, or judgement. 

I found a friend. We would be on the phone for hours. Most of the time we weren't even talking. Just doing our own things while the call was active. We would occasionally fall asleep on the phone and it was genuinely the most comforting thing. The only time I would truly sleep that well is while on the phone with him. He recently got a girlfriend and she obviously isn't okay with him talking to another girl. 

I miss it. Having someone. Anyone. Knowing someone was a breath away. I miss it so much. Not even in a romantic type of way. Just in general. Someone to share good news with. Someone to check up on. Someone to cry to. Someone to laugh with. Watch shows/movies with. Someone to help motivate me. I just miss being not so alone.",1
i’m done,"well unless my mind is changed or there’s drastic improvement by the end of the year, i’m not going to exist next year. i’ve endured too much and life has fucked me over and over without end. major depression has just spiralled since i was young and my mental and physical stability has done the same. i’ve tried everything from therapy to drugs and nothing helps or changes. i should have done it years ago but i met someone who i stayed around for. now that they are gone there’s nothing really keeping me here any longer. so if there isn’t a significant positive change in my life by the end of the year or someone convinced me otherwise, it’s over. 💀",1

I feel like i keep coming back on here.,"Hi Reddit.

This is just a little rant in no particular order of how my life is as a kind of journal for people who may be going through a similar dark period in their life like myself.

I am 27 year old male who feels like the biggest loser in the world. I am jobless still in college and live with my parents. I've failed a class and can't find an internship willing to hire me and i don't really blame them. I have developed diabetes and am now getting issues with my vision because of it (i'm going in for a surgery on my right eye soon if i bother). i just feel like im lost and behind compared to my peers and friends.

I have a loving girlfriend but i feel bad for her... i feel like she only loses things in her life and im afraid she'll lose me too. My girlfriend is a great person who only sees the best in people. shes hard working and cares alot about her family and i love her alot too as shes always and still is there for me but i just feel bad. i feel like im a tumor just wasting her life away by making her spend it on a guy like me.

I feel bad for my parents. I know they care, they suck at showing it but i know they care about me. they support me in everything i try to do but i have nothing to show for their support. i feel like i'm a failure as a son who just can't do anything right.

I wish i wasn't born, i wish i could just die but i can't even do that anymore. I stopped cutting myself but i still have thoughts of going back to it. i can't even do that right... i can't do anything right and i can't even function as a human correctly with all my chronic diseases and illness i just keep getting i'm really just tired of it all. I just wanna die and see no point in the future.

I'm trying my best to ""cheer up"" or ""look on the brighter side"" but i dont think there is a brighter side or every time i see a glimmer of hope life just takes a big fat flaming hot shit on it  and kicks it off the side of a mountain.  I just feel like life is a joke and its made so we can suffer.",1
I hate my life,"I just feel bad. It’s started when kids used to be mean to me when I was little. I didn’t have friends and I and felt really sad. With the time I became suicid@l and tried to end my life, I thought that I worth nothing.  But I never succeeded, because I had a part of me that wanted to live a happy life. I just started 10 grade this year in a private school. I met someone I thought that really liked me, we were together all the time until he started becoming violent. I left him with a hole in my heart, because I really liked him. He became obsessed and tried to ruin my life in a really scary ways after the breakup. I become paranoid that he will come to my house and kill me. I saw him waking after me in school. It’s also didn’t help that most of the kids in my class liked to laugh at me. I stopped trusting men and I feel scared to be around people I don’t know. He was kicked out of school because I told to the teacher what he did.everything in my life became scarier. I honestly don’t know why I’m still alive when I literally don’t do anything in my life accept sleeping and watching TV.",1
wtf,"why am i still fighting to stay alive? what is the reason? nothing makes me happy nothing makes me feel okay and i dread going absolutely anywhere and i have nobody to talk too. i’m just waiting for the courage to kms but the courage is so fleeting that it’s hard to act quickly in the moment, i just really hope that i die in some accident as soon as fucking possible. i know i’ll never be happy, the only thing that makes me feel better is mdma",1
Bye I guess,"Hi, I'm a 14 year old male, and plan on committing suicide on my birthday which is in 11 days. I've always had depression and anxiety, but it has gotten horrible since the beginning of my freshman year and finally got to all honors. But for some reason my work ethic has completely gone out the window and I can't focus on anything, even listening to people no matter how long the sentence is hard to do. My early life was filled with weekly whippings from my dad for stuff I never did but was accused of doing by my stepmother. I always got so mad and enraged for the unfairness that I finally managed to drive away the one person I still truly cared for, being my mother. All my friends have slipped through my hands and I rarely converse with them with only 1 exception remaining. My parents accuse me of being manipulative and make assumptions on the first try and stick with it, with outstanding stubbornness. When I look at dozen of personality tests and medical tests(fill out all the criteria for Inattentive Type ADHD and dissociation disorder), they all reveal my depression, anxiety, and the fact I'm an introvert. I tell them and they just accuse me of trying to use it as an excuse, and when I clammed up, a conversation with my dad ended with him saying ""fuck you."" At this point I have very little actual feelings towards him, but something inside me felt sad and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to cry. I'm failing almost all my classes and I feel so shit that I can't get around to work. I wake up at 3 am and avoid people for the rest of the day, eventually going to bed at 10:30. I do have a crush, who has asked if I wanted to hang out, but we constantly fall farther and farther apart even though we seem to get along. Part of the problem is that I always bring the mood down and my job is complaining about my mood and how I can't get stuff done in time. I tried to commit suicide a couple times in elementary school but gave up on it with no real non-painful method, but we finally moved into a 3 story house and a short railing. As of today, my dad ended with ""Get out of my sight, you make me sick. I'm tired of dealing with your bullshit."" This one hurt less, but got me to get off my ass and type this. Anyways, I don't want any sympathy or empathy, but instead offer any accounts I have, since I clearly don't have any plans to use them in the future. Just message me up on discord: JonDav#8698. I hope you all live fruitful lives and enjoy what you have even if you don't want to. Whatever tough love you have going on, just remember that it is still love, it could get much worse.",1
do i sound crazy ?,"i think my depression is halfway just having undiagnosed adhd 

i get suicidal when im doing bad in school

and i do bad in school when i cant focus and get things done 

then when it piles up i get so stressed about it all i can think is i want to die make it stop 

because i feel like a failure and its like dad was right and i dont want him to be right 

i know he tells me im disappointing and how i embarrass him but but i dont want to be all that

and that just because he says those things it doesnt mean i am or whatever but it does

i still dissappointed him so im disappointing 

i still embarrased him so im embarrassing 

i feel like if i could fix that it could fix whatevers making me so sad 

but then i still get suicidal in the summer ? 

so its not all of my depression but it makes it a lot worse

i need to get help i need medication 

i dont even mean like i need drugs like a freak i mean i want to get medicated even just for a little bit to get me off my feet

because it takes 3 weeks to build a habit and the way i am its too hard to just do on my own 

if i didnt have school and deadlines or a job or whatever i think i could maybe do it all by myself but the way things are its just too hard

i tried to do it by myself and i failed every time 

i just need a little help",1

What to do?,"I am a 14m who has recently been feeling depressive symptoms. I don’t know how I would figure out if I have depression or not (medically speaking) do I need to find a therapist or phsycihayrist (can’t spell). I feel I could ask a good amount of people for help but what if I’m actually fine and it looks like I just wanted attention. Should I ask or just wait to see if it passes.

TLDR: might have depression wanna ask for help on diagnosis but if I am actually fine It will be awkward, should I pull the trigger and ask anyways.",1
